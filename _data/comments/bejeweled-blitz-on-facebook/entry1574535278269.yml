  I have been playing this game since I joined Facebook and I think it's a darn
  shame that a person can't never win anymore on the daily challenge.  It's
  always set up where you can not win....I might, if I'm lucky, win once every 6
  to 8 weeks and then it's a worthless boost.I wondered why hardly any of my
  friends play it anymore, now I know and guess I will join them and find
  something else to play.
