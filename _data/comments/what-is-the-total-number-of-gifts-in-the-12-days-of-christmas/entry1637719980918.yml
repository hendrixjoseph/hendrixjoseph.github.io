  I think there is an oversight in that on the first day there are technically
  two gifts received, a partridge and a pear tree. Also overlooked are the facts
  that the six geese are laying eggs, the maids are presumably milking cows, the
  pipers are playing their pipes, and the drummers couldn't be drumming without
  drums, bringing to question, are these accessories thereby also gifts? The
  total gifts if compounded daily then tally to 492... assuming each goose lays
  only one egg.
