  Thank you for attending the Investment Basics workshop. I hope you and your
  wife had a pleasant experience. Covid has caused me to conduct my workshops
  virtually at this point. I do miss the small group atmosphere of the library
  and the interaction that comes with that. I make a very conscious effort to no
  be pushy, but do have confidence in my abilities and the services we offer our
  members. I do try to educate my clients in regards to their investments and
  the vast menu of investment options available. Wish you well.
