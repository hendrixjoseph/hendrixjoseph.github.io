msg: "Hi this is kinda of off topic but I was wanting to \r\nknow if blogs use WYSIWYG editors or if you have to manually \r\ncode with HTML. I'm starting a blog soon but have no coding know-how so \r\nI wanted to get guidance from someone with experience. Any \r\nhelp would be greatly appreciated!"
