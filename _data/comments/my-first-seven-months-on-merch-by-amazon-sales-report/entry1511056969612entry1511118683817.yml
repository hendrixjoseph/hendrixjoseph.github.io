  I don't put too much time into it - maybe a few hours a week. As far as 2018,
  I fear my royalties may go down since Amazon is increasing their fees. I've
  been expanding into other print-on-demand sites, namely
  [Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com/people/joehx) and
  [Teespring](https://teespring.com/stores/joehxs-store), but I haven't had
  nearly the success with those two as I've had with Merch by Amazon.
