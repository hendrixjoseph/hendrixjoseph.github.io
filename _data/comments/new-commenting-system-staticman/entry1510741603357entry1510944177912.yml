  I added a reply feature - it only goes one deep. Also, Staticman supports a
  subscribe feature, but you have to have (or rather, I have to have) a
  [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) account, but I don't want to pay for it.<br /><br />Oh, and I made our last two comments into replies manually :)
