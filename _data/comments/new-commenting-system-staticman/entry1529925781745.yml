msg: "For this form of procedure the incision is normally completed in the area \r\nbehind the ear, as this is probably the most unnoticeable area \r\nand following the surgery the scar will likely be pretty much impossible to see.\r\nAlong with this, it will also hinder the degree of dominance and supremacy \r\nin the organization among others.  although the stress is on counting \"carbs\" rolling around in its place of calories, one does still require \r\nto take less calories than one is burning."
