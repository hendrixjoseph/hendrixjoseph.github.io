msg: "Use apple cider vinegar treatment - Yes, the apple cider with your kitchen is not \r\nonly best for preparing food, it's curative too.\r\nBy the way, if you are concerned you are going to lose energy because you were reducing \r\nyour sugar intake, then you can certainly feel comfortable knowing \r\nthat it's not gonna happen provided you get a lot of good \r\ncarbs as well as a moderate amount of healthy fat.\r\nKeep your elbows straight upwards and move your shoulder off the floor then lift your left leg through the floor about 12 inches."
