msg: "Today, I went to the beach with my kids. I found a \r\nsea shell and gave it to my 4 year old daughter and \r\nsaid \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She put the shell to her ear and screamed.\r\nThere was a hermit crab inside and it pinched her ear. She never wants to go back!\r\nLoL I know this is completely off topic but I had to tell \r\nsomeone!"
