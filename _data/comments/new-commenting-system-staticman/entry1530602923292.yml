msg: "Most people believe cardio exercise is a great method to burn fat \r\nand it can be if done correctly.  You can use \r\nthe formula, or you can determine by yourself how many calories you should eat a day to lose \r\nfat while keeping your body healthy. Constipation and back pain can be \r\nrelieved by switching your diet to encourage bowel \r\nmovements; this generally involves consuming more fiber, fruit, vegetables and water."
