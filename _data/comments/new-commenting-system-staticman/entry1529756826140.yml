msg: "However, as soon as the baby arrives, you might find \r\nyourself wanting to get time for your pre-pregnancy weight or perhaps achieving a designated stomach - \r\nsomething lots of women lose after having children. Avoid offending foods for approximately 3 \r\nmonths, cut down on coffee, nuts, chocolate, insoluble fiber like cereal fiber, alcohol, sorbitol containing candies and gum, beans, bagels,\r\nraisins, onions, lentils, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, brussels sprouts, peas, soybeans etc.\r\nSo just to reiterate, weight reduction is not what we \r\nare after but bodyweight reduction is."
