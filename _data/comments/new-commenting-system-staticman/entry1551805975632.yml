msg: "First off I would like to say terrific blog! I had \r\na quick question which I'd like to ask if you do not mind.\r\nI was interested to find out how you center yourself and clear your \r\nthoughts before writing. I have had a difficult time clearing my thoughts in getting my ideas out.\r\n\r\nI do enjoy writing however it just seems like the \r\nfirst 10 to 15 minutes are generally lost simply just trying to figure out how to begin. Any ideas or hints?\r\nKudos!"
