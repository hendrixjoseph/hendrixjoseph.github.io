msg: "This is completely true because you also need to burn fat from the the surface of \r\nthose muscles you are developing before they can be \r\nseen. Avoid offending foods for around three months, cut down on coffee,\r\nnuts, chocolate, insoluble fiber like cereal fiber, alcohol, \r\nsorbitol containing candies and gum, beans, bagels, raisins,\r\nonions, lentils, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, \r\nbrussels sprouts, peas, soybeans etc. Strenuous exercises for abdominals \r\nthat only work for a couple of minutes will show you great results."
