msg: "Today, I went to the beachfront with my children. \r\nI found a sea shell and gave it to my 4 year old daughter and said \r\n\"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She \r\nplaced the shell to her ear and screamed. There was a hermit crab inside and it pinched her ear.\r\nShe never wants to go back! LoL I know this is totally off topic but I \r\nhad to tell someone!"
