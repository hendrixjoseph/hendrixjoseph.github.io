msg: "Research has established that interval training rich in intense bursts of 60-120 seconds followed by an average recovery amount of 30-60 seconds will produce better \r\nresults.   You might have some serious trauma in your child hood that causes you to definitely turn to food for comfort.\r\n\r\nStart implementing it with your weight-loss regiment asap and commence seeing faster \r\nresults with less time within the gym."
