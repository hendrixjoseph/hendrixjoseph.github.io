msg: "If your lower stomach muscles become weakened on account of constant inactivity or perhaps a sedentary lifestyle they'll relax or become atrophied, that is certainly when you are more likely to develop that unsightly condition known as being a \"gut\" or \r\n\"pot belly.  The risks are extremely high for diabetes to start, blood pressure levels can be high, cardiovascular disease will develop, strokes, lack of sleep, and different types of cancer to mention a few.  Although indigestion or bloating could function as result of anything serious, the anguish can feel so intolerable which it is like something is terribly wrong with one's innards."
