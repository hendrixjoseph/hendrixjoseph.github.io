msg: "For this kind of procedure the incision is normally done in the location behind the ear, because this is one of the most unnoticeable area and following your surgery the scar will be basically impossible to \r\nsee.  Along with this, it could also hinder how much dominance and supremacy in the organization among others.\r\nAlso, even if you contain the right posture but hold the wrong kind of \r\nchair, you'll be able to still be at risk for reconciling pains."
