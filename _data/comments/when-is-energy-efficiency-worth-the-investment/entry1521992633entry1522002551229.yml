message: "PV = present value? I guess my car example had one more assumption that I didn't list: you're paying for the car in cash (i.e. not financing). The other assumptions (all other maintenance costs are the same, gas prices are constant, and your current car is worth zero) are not realistic; I admit this in the explanation below the \"answer.\" This problem of bad assumptions is simply to make the math easier in the case of examples - you see it all the time in physics problems with [frictionless planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frictionless_plane) and [spherical cows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow).\r\n\r\nAnd you're absolutely right - a car that gets 50 mpg probably will cost a lot more than $7,200, which means, money-wise at least, it's best to stick with your current car."
