  Nice! Don't forget about community resources that may fund energy efficiency
  projects for you! Our local library has free LED lightbulbs and more
  available. Many utilities offer free lightbulbs and free energy audits, along
  with financial incentives and rebates for swapping out old, less energy
  efficient appliances.
