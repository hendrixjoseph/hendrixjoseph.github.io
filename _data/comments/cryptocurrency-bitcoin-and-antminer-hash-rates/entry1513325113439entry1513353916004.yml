message: "The Gh/s and the watts columns are just from the bitcoin wiki here -> https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_hardware_comparison\r\n\r\nThose are basically the advertised rates.\r\n\r\nThe reward / block column is just plugging in the Gh/s column into equation shown earlier on the post (but I'll repeat it here):\r\n\r\n$$reward = 16×(0.98)×{Gh/s \\over 1,300,000,000}$$\r\n\r\nreward / day is just the reward / block column multiplied by 24\r\n\r\nkWh / day is the watts column multiplied by 24 and divided by 1000"
