msg: "I think that everything said was very reasonable.\r\nHowever, think about this, suppose you composed a catchier post title?\r\n\r\nI mean, I don't wish to tell you how to run your \r\nblog, but suppose you added a title that makes people desire \r\nmore? I mean blog topic is a little vanilla. You should peek at Yahoo's front page and watch how they create article headlines to grab people to open the \r\nlinks. You might add a related video or a related picture or two to \r\nget readers excited about what you've written. In my \r\nopinion, it would make your posts a little livelier."
