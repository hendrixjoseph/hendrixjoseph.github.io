  I had to use echo -n with the colon-less hex blurb in quotes, pipe it to what
  you have exactly with exception of the -hex, then pipe to base64


  So, echo -n "hex without colons and spaces" | openssl dgst -sign private.key
  -sha256 | base64


  **99% of this came from the hints as they probably thought most of us would
  have issues with this concept.
