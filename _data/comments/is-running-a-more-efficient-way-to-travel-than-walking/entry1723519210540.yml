  Slow walking is very time consuming though. But, never mind the wasted time.
  Is it actually more energy efficient?


  What if we look at the total caloric expenditure over the activity of covering
  a certain distance, say 10 miles?


  By total I mean including basal metabolism, not only the additional
  expenditure for running or walking.


  Does slow walking still look good from purely an energy POV, if it takes four
  hours instead of an hour and a half?
