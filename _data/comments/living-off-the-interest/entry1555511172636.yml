msg: "I believe everything posted made a ton of sense.\r\nBut, think on this, what if you were to write a killer headline?\r\nI am not saying your information isn't good, but suppose you \r\nadded a post title that grabbed a person's attention? I \r\nmean blog topic is kinda plain. You should peek at Yahoo's home page and see how they create \r\npost titles to get viewers to click. You might try adding a video or a picture or two to grab readers excited \r\nabout everything've got to say. Just my opinion, it could bring your posts a little \r\nlivelier."
