message: "At that point, I'm not sure it could be solved in a single equation, although I could see something along the lines of how long would it take you to reach a certain savings rate. For instance, if your income currently equals you expenses (i.e. a savings rate of 0%) how long would it take to reach a 50% savings rate if you get a 3% raise every year and save it?\r\n\r\nI just did a quick excel sheet, and the answer to that question that looks like around 24 years:\r\n\r\nyear | income | savings | savings rate\r\n---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | \r\n0 | 100 | 0 | 0.0%\r\n1 | 103 | 3 | 2.9%\r\n2 | 106.09 | 6.09 | 5.7%\r\n3 | 109.27 | 9.27 | 8.5%\r\n4 | 112.55 | 12.55 | 11.2%\r\n5 | 115.92 | 15.92 | 13.7%\r\n6 | 119.40 | 19.40 | 16.3%\r\n7 | 122.98 | 22.98 | 18.7%\r\n8 | 126.67 | 26.67 | 21.1%\r\n9 | 130.47 | 30.47 | 23.4%\r\n10 | 134.39 | 34.39 | 25.6%\r\n11 | 138.42 | 38.42 | 27.8%\r\n12 | 142.57 | 42.57 | 29.9%\r\n13 | 146.85 | 46.85 | 31.9%\r\n14 | 151.25 | 51.25 | 33.9%\r\n15 | 155.79 | 55.79 | 35.8%\r\n16 | 160.47 | 60.47 | 37.7%\r\n17 | 165.28 | 65.28 | 39.5%\r\n18 | 170.24 | 70.24 | 41.3%\r\n19 | 175.35 | 75.35 | 43.0%\r\n20 | 180.61 | 80.61 | 44.6%\r\n21 | 186.02 | 86.02 | 46.2%\r\n22 | 191.61 | 91.61 | 47.8%\r\n23 | 197.35 | 97.35 | 49.3%\r\n24 | 203.27 | 103.27 | 50.8%"
