For instance, if your income currently equals you expenses (i.e. a savings rate of 0%) how long would it take to reach a 50% savings rate if you get a 3% raise every year and save it?\r\n\r\nI just did a quick excel sheet, and the answer to that question that looks like around 24 years:\r\n\r\nyear | income | savings | savings rate\r\n---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | \r\n0 | 100 | 0 | 0.0%\r\n1 | 103 | 3 | 2.9%\r\n2 | 106.09 | 6.09 | 5.7%\r\n3 | 109.2727 | 9.2727 | 8.5%\r\n4 | 112.550881 | 12.550881 | 11.2%\r\n5 | 115.9274074 | 15.92740743 | 13.7%\r\n6 | 119.4052297 | 19.40522965 | 16.3%\r\n7 | 122.9873865 | 22.98738654 | 18.7%\r\n8 | 126.6770081 | 26.67700814 | 21.1%\r\n9 | 130.4773184 | 30.47731838 | 23.4%\r\n10 | 134.3916379 | 34.39163793 | 25.6%\r\n11 | 138.4233871 | 38.42338707 | 27.8%\r\n12 | 142.5760887 | 42.57608868 | 29.9%\r\n13 | 146.8533713 | 46.85337135 | 31.9%\r\n14 | 151.2589725 | 51.25897249 | 33.9%\r\n15 | 155.7967417 | 55.79674166 | 35.8%\r\n16 | 160.4706439 | 60.47064391 | 37.7%\r\n17 | 165.2847632 | 65.28476323 | 39.5%\r\n18 | 170.2433061 | 70.24330612 | 41.3%\r\n19 | 175.3506053 | 75.35060531 | 43.0%\r\n20 | 180.6111235 | 80.61112347 | 44.6%\r\n21 | 186.0294572 | 86.02945717 | 46.2%\r\n22 | 191.6103409 | 91.61034089 | 47.8%\r\n23 | 197.3586511 | 97.35865111 | 49.3%\r\n24 | 203.2794106 | 103.2794106 | 50.8%"
