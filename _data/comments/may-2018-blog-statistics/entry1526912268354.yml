msg: "Today, I went to the beach with my children. I found a sea shell \r\nand gave it to my 4 year old daughter and said \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She placed the \r\nshell to her ear and screamed. There was a hermit crab inside and it \r\npinched her ear. She never wants to go back!\r\nLoL I know this is totally off topic but I had to tell someone! http://www.mbet88vn.com"
