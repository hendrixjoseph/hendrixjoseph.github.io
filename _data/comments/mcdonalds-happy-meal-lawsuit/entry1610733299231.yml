message: "Here I am, ten years later, re-reading what I wrote ten years ago.\r\n\r\nToday, I have two kids: a one-year-old daughter and an almost three-year-old son. Is it hard to say no to them? Absolutely! Do I occasionally say no to them? Yes, I will often tell them no.\r\n\r\nIncluding:\r\n\r\n* No TV.\r\n* No more TV.\r\n* Eat this before you can have that.\r\n\r\nWe'll see what the next 10 years brings, however."
