  I signed up for Bumped based on your referral, maybe 6-8 months ago. I've
  earned about $40 after linking all my cards and forgetting about it. I did try
  to withdraw the money, and it de-linked my bank account while trying to do
  that. I had to relink it, but did the money out. I will say that their app
  makes it difficult to cash out, but I like the concept.
