message: "I received in the mail today a [1099-NEC](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-nec) from Square, Inc. today.\r\n\r\nIt states that I received **$19,280** in \"nonemployee compensation\" - box 1.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind I only was able to withdrawal $1,050 before my account closed. And I was only able to track - via the emails I was receiving - $16,650 worth of referrals (or 1,665 referrals). That means I probably received another 263 referrals before Square was able to close that end of the issue.\r\n\r\nNote that I'm only going to pay taxes on the referral money I actually received - that is, I'm only going to pay taxes on $1,050, not $19,280. If there's a place to note the discrepancy on my taxes somewhere, I'll be sure to do that. Otherwise, I'll have to see if the IRS audits me."
