msg: "Ever see needs to have a contact page. Websites ranging in space and class \r\nfrom your local restaurant to some Fortune 500 company, have contact pages.\r\nWithin current startup I have seen a wide range of requests… from \r\nthe pizza delivery guy letting us know he was at the front end \r\ndoor to potential investors looking to speak with his management team.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you find yourself setting your contact page (and finding \r\nthe traffic volume of any local restaurant) would likely not be thinking about how to handle \r\nyour contact requests when traffic increases. Nevertheless, you should.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContemplate setting up automation that alerts support, sales as well as other stakeholders with \r\nyour company when a message request comes through. You could \r\nmake a dropdown field in a questionnaire for varieties of contact requests.\r\nYou possibly can setup logic for most marketing automation platforms that sends email alerts to the appropriate resource within your startup determined by the kind of \r\nrequest the viewer selects.\r\n\r\nI used to be buried with contact requests after we \r\nlaunched beta. As being a cloud-based product I saw many product support requests.\r\n\r\nSo that we mapped form submissions on our contact page \r\nto produce support tickets in Zendesk.\r\n\r\nYou should arrange redundancies so contact requests (important ones!) don't explore 1 recipient's inbox.\r\nYou'll be able to alert multiple recipients, create reminder emails,\r\nor trigger automatic replies get in touch with requests with information which may solve their \r\nproblem. This 's all very easy to setup with all-in-one marketing platforms like \r\nHubSpot."
