msg: "Watch must have a message page. Websites ranging in size and \r\nsophistication from the local restaurant to the Fortune 500 company, have contact \r\npages. Inside my current startup I have come across an array of requests… through the pizza delivery guy \r\nletting us know he was in front door to potential investors looking to chat with our management team.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you find yourself setting your contact page (and getting the traffic volume of \r\nyour local restaurant) you possibly will not be thinking about how to manage your \r\ncontact requests when site traffic increases.\r\nBut the truth is should.\r\n\r\nThink of configuring automation that alerts support, sales and other stakeholders as part of your company when a message request comes through.\r\nYou may create a dropdown field in a questionaire for different types \r\nof contact requests. You may create logic in many marketing automation platforms that sends email alerts to the right resource as \r\npart of your startup based on the kind of request the \r\nviewer selects.\r\n\r\nI was buried with contact requests once we launched beta.\r\n\r\nTo be a cloud-based product I saw many product support requests.\r\nSo we mapped form submissions on our contact page to develop support tickets in Zendesk.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou should also build redundancies so contact requests (important ones!) don't get lost in 1 recipient's inbox.\r\nYou'll be able to alert multiple recipients, create reminder emails, or \r\ntrigger automatic replies to get hold of requests with information that might \r\nsolve their problem. This is perhaps all quite simple \r\nto build with all-in-one marketing platforms like HubSpot."
