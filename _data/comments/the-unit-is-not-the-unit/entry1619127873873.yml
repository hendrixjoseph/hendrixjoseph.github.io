  That's so smart!  Unit pricing only makes sense if you know you are going to
  use everything you buy in the time it stays usable, and that by buying more
  you won't automatically use more.  That appeals to the engineer in me, I often
  saw people trying to solve the wrong problems.  Sometimes the lowest energy
  machine wasn't the best choice because it couldn't really do the job.  I had a
  boss who got a good deal on sheetrock when he was building a house, so he
  bought way more than he needed.  That was thirty years ago and I think it is
  still sitting in one of his sheds.  Not smart.
