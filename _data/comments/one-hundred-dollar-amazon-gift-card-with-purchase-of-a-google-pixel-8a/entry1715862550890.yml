  I forget to mention - I purchased this using my Chase Freedom card, which
  offers 5% cash back this quarter on Amazon.


  So that netted me another $24.95 "off" of this phone, bringing the net cost
  down to $374.05.


  If you don't already have a Chase Freedom card, you probably don't have enough
  time to get one before this deal is over. But in any case, here are my
  referral links for the various Chase Freedom cards:


  * [Chase Freedom Flex](https://www.joehxblog.com/chase-freedom-flex/)

  * [Chase Freedom
  Unlimited](https://www.joehxblog.com/chase-freedom-unlimited/)

  * [Chase Freedom](https://www.joehxblog.com/chase-freedom/)


  Note that the 5% category is only available on the Chase Freedom Flex; the
  Chase Freedom Unlimited is just a simple 1.5% cash back. The "OG" Chase
  Freedom (with no end-qualifier) is no longer available, but I believe you can
  get either of the other two Chase Freedom cards through any of the above
  referral links.
