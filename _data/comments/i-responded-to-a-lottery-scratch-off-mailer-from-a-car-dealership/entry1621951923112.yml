message: "Since I've been running for about an hour a day (during the week) and these free, cheap headphones only last 45 minutes, I went and bought a new pair.\r\n\r\nI didn't get something expensive like [Apple Airpods](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZPC9QD4/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) or [Samsung Galaxy Buds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083KVM9VW/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) (seriously, though, all the sites that are on the top of Google search for \"best wireless earbuds\" are showing $100+ earbuds). Instead, I bought a pair of [AUKEY True Wireless Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/447E6560-00EC-4DE8-A1C1-AD538ECFEBE6?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) for about twenty bucks.\r\n\r\nThey feel about the same as my old free ones, but still have plenty of charge even after my one-hour run. And they're easier to use, too."
