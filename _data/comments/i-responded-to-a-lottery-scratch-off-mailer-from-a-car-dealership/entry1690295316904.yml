  I've worked at an a printing company for several years. We don't print
  anything on cups, shirts, pens etc. We print on paper only. Business cards,
  magazines, mailers, flyers, etc. Every 3 months we had a car company (very
  well known car dealership) that would order of 100,000 of these exact flyers.
  Same purpose, same promise, and same cheesy flyers which read in huge
  letters...
   "YOU COULD BE THE NEXT LUCKY WINNER OF ONE OF THE FABULOUS PRIZES. A BRAND NEW $25,000 CAR, A $7,000 POLARIS SPORTSMAN 450, A $1000 GAS GIFT CARD, A 55" SOMY TV, A $500 PLAYSTATION 5, A $250 BLU-RAY PLAYER, OR A $29.99 PAIR OF WIRELESS AIR BUDS. **DONT GIVE UP** EVEN IF YOUR CODE DOESNT MATCH THE WINNING COMBINATION WE'RE DOING SOMETHING NEVER DONE BEFORE AND THAT MEANS WE'VE DECIDED TO STILL GIVE EVERYONE A CHANCE TO BRING THE KEY THAT CAME ATTACHED TO YOUR MAIL FLYER AND TRY YOUR CHANCE AT STARTING UP THAT BRAND NEW $25,000 CAR AND IF YOUR KEY STARTS UP THAT ENGINE THEN YOU GET TO DRIVE IT OFF THE LOT BECAUSE ITS YOURS! ITS THAT SIMPLE. LIMITED TIME ONLY SO GATHER THE FAMILY AND COME ON DOWN TO SEE IF IT'S YOUR LUCKY DAY!

  Finest print ever:odds of winning anything even the "$29.99 earbuds that cost
  $1.43 are 1 in 66trillion. basically you're more likely to get eaten by a 26ft
  great white man eating shark on land than you at winning the China earbuds.you
  guys don't even Wana know the odds of winning that $25,000 car do you? ok for
  fun only...there are no odds because of course no key would every start up
  anything except the key that fits whatever piece of sh*t you wasted gas and
  time to drive here but on your way out we do have a nice mardi gras type cup,
  a pen with our dealership info on it for our promotional purposes and a
  business card in case you decide to come back and purchase the damn car
  because tax season is coming up. Take care now
