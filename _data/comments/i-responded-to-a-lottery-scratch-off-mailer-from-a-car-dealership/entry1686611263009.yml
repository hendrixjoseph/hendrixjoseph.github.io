  I got a scratch off saying my amazon card could be worth $25.00-$10,000 an of
  course I had the big prize winner. I text it to Nissan dealership in Newnan Ga
  they responded with in 20 minutes to pick a day thats convenience for me to
  come in. I screenshot a lot of replies about these fake scratch offs and sent
  it to them. That was @6:12pm. I've heard no response but I thanked them and
  promised to post it for anyone who received this scratch off can see.
