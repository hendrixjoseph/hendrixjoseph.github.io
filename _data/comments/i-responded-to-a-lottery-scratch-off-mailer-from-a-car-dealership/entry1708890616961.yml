  I was looking for this report when i got a car dealership junk mailer for
  Pryor, Oklahoma to Play The 25,000 Prize Is Right Game that you pull the tabs
  and everybody wins, Like I did thinking I won 5,000 but you have to take it to
  them to confirm the confirmation code to see if you really won anything!

  The fine print says if the tabs match for the 25,000 you are entered into a
  contest to win the 25,000, And what about some other fine print at the
  dealership that's not on the flyer that says the prize money goes to a down
  payment of a car?
