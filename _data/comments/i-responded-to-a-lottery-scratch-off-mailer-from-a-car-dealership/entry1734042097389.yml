  I received a "Big Win" game in my mailbox. Today they ask to pull open the
  tabs above. The middle tabs have the 

  "777 <--> 777". The statement on the paper claims that I won $1000.00 cash
  with odds 1:40000. Happy, I call to the dealership using a provided on the
  paper number. After long set of voice advertisements on the phone I was able
  to connect with a life person. He invited me to come to the dealership to play
  the second round of the game. On my argument, that such option was not
  mentioned on the sent to me paper he stated that it was. However, he mentioned
  a $1000.00 during the conversation. I never mentioned the amount of the prize
  I won. So, he knew exactly which combinations were sent in Delray Beach
  County! It triggered me to observe the mail more carefully. And find something
  that I missed: "Matching symbols does not denote prize won", etc. I fall to
  the old trick created by used car salesmen morons!
