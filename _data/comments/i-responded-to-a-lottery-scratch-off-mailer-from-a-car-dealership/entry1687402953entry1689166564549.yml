  I'm so happy to have found this article and your comment. I live in the
  Morristown TN area and we received one of these gimmicky games from Morristown
  Ford. My husband was about to fall for it especially after just returning from
  a cross country vacation and thinking the "$1000 winnings" would help us
  post-traveling. The cheap prize on this mailer is a Bluetooth Waterproof
  Speaker and it states, "$25 value; odds 1:1 should no other prize be won" I'm
  sure if he took the time to go out there with the pull tab that shows he won
  $1000, he'd walk out with only a very cheap speaker that's more than likely
  Dollar Tree quality and was Made in China.
