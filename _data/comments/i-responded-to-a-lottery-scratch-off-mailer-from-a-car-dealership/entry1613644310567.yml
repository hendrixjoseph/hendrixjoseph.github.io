  Haha, always wondered what the deal was with the sleezy car dealership junk
  mail  that I would get. Also, I had the same exact pair of headphones, they’re
  actually the super duper cheap kind that’s  made in China. Pretty much dollar
  store headphones. I bought mine for 5 bucks on Wish. So I’m sure the schmuck
  heads at the dealership got a big box of those for 50 bucks bulk style.
