  They have been claiming over a year now that they have repaid millions but
  they provide no evidence. I have asked. I will be blunt. I invested 15k and
  now with interest it claims to be worth over $18k. Just this week I received a
  reply form support that indicated to me they will more than likely file to
  default completely on this. I doubt anyone will ever get their money back from
  this one. Yet they make bold claims online to the current products. Makes no
  sense to me how this can keep going on.
