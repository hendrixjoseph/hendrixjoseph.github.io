  This is sickening. Sure we know its not fdic however their claims of being
  able to sale loan borrowers collateral to pay us investors back is a bold face
  lie. This has been going on for a year but yet they are offering and selling
  other investments like their community, property loans etc. However those like
  me that invested in the beginning into worthy peer capital have yet to see a
  return on our capital. I've gotten money back from the other offerings that
  came after peer capital but I can't withdraw what I have left which is over
  5k. I'll never invest in them again.
