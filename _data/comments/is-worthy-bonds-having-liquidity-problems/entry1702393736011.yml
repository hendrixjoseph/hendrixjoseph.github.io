  This is a copy of the agreement we all consented to when we purchased Worthy
  Peer Capital Bonds. Note his discouraging paragraph: (b)

  INVESTMENT IN THE BONDS IS HIGHLY RISKY AND YOU MAY LOSE ALL YOUR INVESTMENT.
  THESE ARE SPECULATIVE SECURITIES. YOU SHOULD PURCHASE THESE SECURITIES ONLY IF
  YOU CAN AFFORD A COMPLETE LOSS OF YOUR INVESTMENT. BEFORE PURCHASING A BOND,
  YOU SHOULD REVIEW THE RISK DISCLOSURES AND OTHER TERMS OF THE SECURITIES
  OFFERING AVAILABLE IN THE WORTHY FORM 1-A OFFERING STATEMENT ON THE SECâ€™S
  EDGAR FILINGS DATABASE AT HTTP://WWW.SEC.GOV.


  It appears we most likely will lose most if not all of what we invested in
  Peer Capital I and II. Sad, indeed!
