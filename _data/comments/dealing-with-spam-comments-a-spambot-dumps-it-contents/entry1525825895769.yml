msg: "What does this mean? In the practical sense,\r\nnot much… but in the legal world, it works as a sort of sleight-of-hand that protects Uber in the event of a \r\nlawsuit. You see, under the law, employers are considered to \r\nbe more responsible for the actions of their employees than they are for the actions of their \r\nindependent contractors.\r\nUber has used this argument to protect itself against third party plaintiffs \r\nmany times, including in a lawsuit filed by the family of a young girl who was killed by an Uber driver while crossing the \r\nstreet. If they can use that defense against an innocent child, you can bet they’ll use it against you!\r\n\r\nHowever, this issue is still a legally hazy one.\r\nStrong legal precedent has not yet been established on this particular question, and different \r\ncourts have come to different conclusions. Right now, the status quo seems to be that \r\nUber drivers are considered employees in some areas, and independent contractors in others.\r\n\r\nRegardless, you can be certain that if you were hit by an Uber driver, the company will do what it \r\ncan to avoid having to pay you a dime. In these situations, \r\na personal injury attorney is more important than ever, and one with experiences \r\nin Uber cases is a definite plus. If you find yourself in an Uber accident,\r\nyou should take the same steps that you should take after any automobile accident.\r\n\r\nThese steps include protecting your own safety by getting out of the line of immediate danger and calling 911 if anyone has been injured, remaining at \r\nthe scene and sharing insurance information with any other drivers who were involved, calling the \r\npolice if the accident is serious, and reporting it to your insurance company."
