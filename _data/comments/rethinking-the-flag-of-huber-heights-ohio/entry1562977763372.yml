message: "My wife suggested I point out any symbolism in the flag. I didn't add any symbolism, but the original did.\r\n\r\nThe two H's obviously represent Huber Heights. The circular shape they are in represents an \"O\" for \"Ohio.\"\r\n\r\nThe two double-bands represent the two major thoroughfares that go through Huber Heights - [Brandt Pike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Route_201) and [Old Troy Pike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Route_202).\r\n\r\nThere are seventeen stars. Ohio was the seventeenth state admitted to the Union.\r\n\r\nGreen and blue, for some reason, are colors \"that had come to represent\" Huber Heights. Don't know why."
