msg: "Every business should have a contact page.\r\nWebsites ranging in size and sophistication at a local restaurant to \r\na Fortune 500 company, have contact pages. Within current startup \r\nWe have a variety of requests… from your pizza delivery guy letting us know he was in the door \r\nto potential investors looking to speak with \r\nour management team.\r\n\r\nWhen you find yourself setting increase your contact page (and getting the traffic volume of any local restaurant) would likely not be thinking about how \r\nto handle your contact requests when site traffic increases.\r\nBut the truth is should.\r\n\r\nTake into consideration establishing automation that alerts support, sales or some other stakeholders in the company when an e-mail request \r\ncomes through. You may create a dropdown field in submit form for varieties \r\nof contact requests. You can create logic for most marketing automation platforms that \r\nsends email alerts to the suitable resource as part of your startup \r\naccording to the kind of request the viewer selects.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was buried with contact requests when we launched beta.\r\n\r\nLike a cloud-based product I saw many product support requests.\r\nAnd then we mapped form submissions on our contact page \r\nto build support tickets in Zendesk.\r\n\r\nYou need to setup redundancies so contact requests (important ones!) don't explore \r\none particular recipient's inbox. It is possible to alert multiple recipients, create reminder emails, or trigger automatic \r\nreplies to contact requests with information which could solve \r\ntheir problem. This is actually easy to set up with all-in-one marketing platforms \r\nlike HubSpot."
