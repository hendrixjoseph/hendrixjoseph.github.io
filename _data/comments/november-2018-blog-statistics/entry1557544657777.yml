msg: "First of all I would like to say excellent blog! I had a \r\nquick question that I'd like to ask if you do not mind. I was interested to find out how you center yourself and clear your thoughts before \r\nwriting. I've had a hard time clearing my \r\nthoughts in getting my thoughts out. I truly do enjoy writing but it just seems like the first 10 to 15 minutes tend to be wasted just trying to figure out how \r\nto begin. Any suggestions or tips? Thanks! https://www.sailblogs.com/member/situscemeqiuqiu/457913/"
