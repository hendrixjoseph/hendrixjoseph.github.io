msg: "Watch must have a message page. Websites \r\nranging bigger and class originating from a local restaurant \r\nto some Fortune 500 company, have contact pages. Within my current startup I've come across a variety of requests… through the pizza delivery \r\nguy letting us know he was at the cab end door to potential investors looking to talk with \r\nhis management team.\r\n\r\nIf you find yourself setting the contact page (and getting the traffic volume of any local restaurant) you might not want to think about how to handle your contact requests when site traffic increases.\r\n\r\nBut you should.\r\n\r\nThink about creating automation that alerts support, sales and other stakeholders inside your \r\ncompany when a communication request comes through.\r\nYou could make a dropdown field in an application for forms of \r\ncontact requests. You possibly can setup logic generally in most marketing automation platforms \r\nthat sends email alerts to the proper resource within your startup based on the type of request the viewer selects.\r\n\r\n\r\nI became buried with contact requests when we launched beta.\r\nAs being a cloud-based product I saw many product support requests.\r\nAnd then we mapped form submissions on our contact page to \r\ndevelop support tickets in Zendesk.\r\n\r\nYou also want to setup redundancies so contact requests \r\n(important ones!) don't explore a particular recipient's inbox.\r\nYou may alert multiple recipients, create reminder emails, \r\nor trigger automatic replies to contact requests with information that will solve their problem.\r\n\r\nThis is actually quite simple to setup with all-in-one marketing platforms like HubSpot."
