msg: "First of all I would like to say excellent blog! I had a quick question that I'd like to ask if you do not \r\nmind. I was interested to find out how you center yourself and clear your thoughts before writing.\r\nI've had a hard time clearing my thoughts in getting my thoughts out.\r\nI truly do enjoy writing but it just seems like the first 10 to 15 minutes tend to be wasted just trying to figure out how to begin. Any suggestions \r\nor tips? Thanks! https://www.sailblogs.com/member/situscemeqiuqiu/457913/"
