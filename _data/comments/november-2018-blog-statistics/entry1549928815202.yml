msg: "Ever see needs to have a contact page. Websites ranging in size \r\nand sophistication originating from a local restaurant with a Fortune \r\n500 company, have contact pages. Inside my current startup I've \r\nseen a variety of requestsâ€¦ through the pizza delivery guy \r\nletting us know he was at the cab end door to potential investors looking to \r\ntalk with the management team.\r\n\r\nWhen you find yourself setting up your contact \r\npage (and getting the traffic volume of a local restaurant) you do not be considering how to \r\ntake care of your contact requests when traffic increases.\r\nHowever you should.\r\n\r\nLook at setting up automation that alerts support, sales as well as other stakeholders in your company when a message request comes \r\nthrough. You may create a dropdown field in an application for different types of contact requests.\r\nYou may set up logic practically in most marketing \r\nautomation platforms that sends email alerts to the correct resource \r\nas part of your startup based upon the kind of request the viewer selects.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had been buried with contact requests even as launched beta.\r\nAs a cloud-based product I saw many product support requests.\r\nAnd we all mapped form submissions on our contact page to \r\ncreate support tickets in Zendesk.\r\n\r\nYou need to set up redundancies so contact requests (important ones!) don't get lost in 1 recipient's inbox.\r\nYou'll be able to alert multiple recipients, create reminder emails, or trigger automatic replies get in touch with requests with information which could solve their problem.\r\n\r\nThis is all quite simple to setup with all-in-one marketing platforms like HubSpot."
