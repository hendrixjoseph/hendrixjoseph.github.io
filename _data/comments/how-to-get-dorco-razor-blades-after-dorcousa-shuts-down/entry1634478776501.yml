message: "Dorco made it's reputation in the US when they were selling their own blades.  I stocked up on Pace 6+ blades everytime they had a sale.  When they said they were moving to Amazon, I bought more and another handle.\r\n\r\nWhile I'm still using that hoard, I checked them out on Amazon in 2020.  Lot's said they were trash because the handle and blades were redesigned.   I just checked today and it looks like they brought the old Pace 6+ back and now call it the Pace 6 Sport.  Unsurprisingly, reviews are great. The only difference is the plastic.  + was white, and Sport is black."
