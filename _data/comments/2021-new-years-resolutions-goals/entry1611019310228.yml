message: "I forgot one financial goal - max out my bonus 5% grocery category with my new [Chase Freedom Flex](https://www.joehxblog.com/chase-freedom/) card.\r\n\r\nThe terms for the 5% effectively were:\r\n\r\n> Earn 5% cash back on grocery store purchases (not including Target® or Walmart® purchases) on up to $12,000 spent in the first year.\r\n\r\nMy first transaction was on October 1, 2020 - so I have at the latest October 1, 2021 to complete $12,000 spend at grocery stores. Of course, I don't want to spend money just to get the 5% back, but there are some things I can do (such as buy a Kroger gift card in-store to use at the pump) that can move spending from a non-grocery location to a grocery location.\r\n\r\nI'm unsure if Chase is still offering that particular bonus, but they always seem to offer some sort of bonus, so feel free to use either [this referral link](https://www.joehxblog.com/chase-freedom-unlimited/) or [that referral link](https://www.joehxblog.com/chase-freedom/)."
