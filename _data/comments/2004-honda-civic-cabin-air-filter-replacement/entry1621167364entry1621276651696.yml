message: "If you just put the filter in wrong, you should just be able to take them out and turn them around. Although if it's been awhile, I'd suggest getting new filters because there's probably a build up of dust and dirt on one side that would end up being pushed into the system.\r\n\r\nIf you somehow put the whole plastic holder thing in wrong so that it got jammed in there, you're probably just going to have to try to force it out. It might break things - hopefully just the plastic holder thing. If the plastic holder thing is broken, you can find a new one. It looks like it's part number 80295-SDA-A00 or 80290-SDA-A01.\r\n\r\nHere's some links to buy it:\r\n\r\n* <https://www.hondapartsnow.com/genuine/honda~filter~assy~80290-sda-a01.html>\r\n* <https://www.amazon.com/Genuine-Honda-80290-SDA-A01-Conditioner-Assembly/dp/B00LOB7ELC/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20>\r\n* <https://www.ebay.com/itm/392723324248?epid=1018877902&hash=item5b70225d58:g:mPwAAOSwqSlgJ5AL&mkcid=1&mkrid=711-53200-19255-0&siteid=0&campid=5337996799&customid=&toolid=10001&mkevt=1>"
