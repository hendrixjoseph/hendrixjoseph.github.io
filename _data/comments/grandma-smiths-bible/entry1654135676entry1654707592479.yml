  If she's your 2nd great grandmother and my 4th great grandmother, does that

  I do see [Mary Cromer's grave on
  Find-a-Grave](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/19088618/mary-cromer).


  Ancestry.com is also pointing to a couple of US Census records (1850 & 1860)
  as well as a couple possible immigration records.
