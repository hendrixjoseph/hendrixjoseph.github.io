msg: "Seek north western\r\n\r\ni came across a post of Twitter that was a screenshot of a post that came from here. In the post a person says, Offense to the Army but BTS are not the kpop act to appear in the usa, And are not the first to sign under america label.\r\n\r\nThe user noted that:\r\n\r\nAnd Wonder Girls is the first kpop act to debut in American and he actually won an award in AMA was the first to debut on American TV and that CL was the first one to appear on the Late Late ShowPsy, craig'slist, BigBang, And SNSD are one of the artists that won in YouTube Awards in American (and moreover Europe)SuJu was the first kpop group to win in the vicinity of KoreaPsy, BigBang, And CL are the initial to sign under an American labelJinusean was the first kpop act to work with UNICEF (and that BigBang, SuJu, TVXQ, Epik extraordinary, 2ne1, m(a), Shinee, etc,and others support UNICEF) what type of bull sh\r\n\r\nIt is well liked in the Kpop fandom to hate on ARMYs and Bts. It really hogwash. Bts have done nothing to you and neither have ARMYs. do you know what we have? the pair of us (Bts coupled with ARMYs) Have worked our asses off as a unit in order that Bts can achieve all that they can. merely, They may not be the first group to do those thing but i'll just tell this; They are the only one of those previously mentioned acts that promises any form of longevity.\r\n\r\nWhat the OP failed to mention is that many of these acts have waned from the public eye here in America. Psy is considered a thing of the past and, using due respect, He was never taken all that seriously at the start. CL had increased but it barely had any radio play (If most). The only other acts to really make it outside of the kpop bubble here in the US is BigBang, SNSD, Shinee, on top of that 2ne1 (and if they disbanded).\r\n\r\nBts have done an amazing job of crossing over while not having to sell out and betray their original image and purpose. Bts make music with a direct impact, With some text. All and I repeat all of their members like music (which make it, playing it, or anything else,.,and so.) they provide the best rapline in kpop (And in this rapline they actually have and though Bts has made mistakes they have shown an familiarity with their wrongdoings and consistent growth.\r\n\r\nI am well aware that the OP was merely jealous of Bts and their accomplishments. It hard not to be when they achieving new things every day and reaching heights that their faves could only dream of. OP is upset because their faves aren still getting recognition for things they did years ago when really, It all pops up to longevity. Bts went to the BBMAs and made a name for their own reasons. next they have consistently stayed in the public eye.\r\n\r\nI don understand why antis always try to assert some kind of opinion that to seek success is to seek western validation if they group seeking it is Bts. Because when it any kind of group charting and breaking records, It amazing. I don realize why antis try to act like Bts aren making history and this history isn opening doors and kicking down boundaries. Well guess [url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/charmdate]charmdate.com[/url] i am aware. It on account, whether or not this Bts then it shouldn count\r\n\r\nSo while I agree that Bts may not be the first to do popular things, They are surely powerful and have created a name for themselves that no one else has.\r\n\r\n(usually, i think it was quite petty to bring up the UNICEF thing. It charitable organizations, Don you dare try to compare charity, Something that is supposed to help and better people lives. That childish and completely bizarre. Saving people/helping people is not a race nor is it a contest.)\r\n\r\nHomeless in Western vermont?\r\n\r\nI sufficiently fortunate to own my home and want it to be known as a safe place for disabled, chronically ill, at your inner levels ill, LGBTQA+, Abuse survivors, PoC, junior, And any marginalized people that are facing homelessness or an unsafe living situation to come for help. I live off SSI and don have many possibilities to help with donations, But I have land it's camp on, your kitchen and bath access, And if every body feels safe indoor bedspace as well.\r\n\r\nPlease signal boost and share with individuals in my geographic area.\r\n\r\nBecoming sterling Mystics Again The Huffington Post\r\n\r\nEinstein was asked toward the bottom of his life if he had any regrets. He clarified: Wish I had read more of the mystics earlier in my life. This is a huge confession, Coming as it does from about the most geniuses of the 20th century, A man who moved beyond the modern science of Newton and ushered in a postmodern science and intelligence.\r\n\r\nin the western world, entertaining world age (explanation the 16th to mid 20th centuries) Was not only blind to, but usually hostile to, Mysticism. As Theodore Roszak has placed it, Enlightenment held mysticism up for poker fun at as the worst offense against science and reason. today, Both educational and religion are often hostile to mysticism. Fundamentalism by meaning is antimystical or distorts mysticism, And much of liberal theology and religion is so academic and left brained that it numbs and ignores the most effective brain, which might our mystical brain. Seminaries teach few practices start viewing our mysticism. This is why many find religion so boring it lacks the action and inner exploration that our souls yearn for. As street. John through the Cross said, Out in the birthday deep. launching into the depths into the deep ocean of the unconscious and of the Great Self, Which is connected to all things and to the Creator often gets stymied by Western religious dogma, Guilt vacations and institutional churchiness. The mystic gets deprived. Patriarchal culture by itself is unable to tap into the deep feminine aspects of Divine Wisdom and Compassion and the heart. having said that the mystics, male and female, Do not present a one sided world, As Patriarchy absolutely does. some yin/yang, Female/male dialectic is alive and well in the mystical way of life. God as Mother is honored collectively with God as Father. by means this, Mystics seek perception, Not mere information.\r\n\r\nThe West remains so out of touch with its own mystical tradition that many Westerners seeking mysticism still feel watertight and weatherproof go East to find it. While this can work for many brave and generous someone, It cannot work for the entire culture. Carl Jung warned us that westerners cannot be pirates thieving wisdom from foreign shores that it has taken them centuries to create as if our own culture was an error outlived. Western culture an outlived Or is there wisdom deep within our roots that can be accessed anew and that can give us strength and understanding at this critical time when so much is falling apart in the world, When global warming and destruction of the earth accelerates and [url=http://charmdatecom.wixsite.com/charmdate]charmdate review[/url] so many species are disappearing, While our banking systems and monetary climate belief systems, Our forms of instruction and forms of worship, Are unable?\r\n\r\nI believe that there are great wisdom in our species and in Western spiritual traditions, But in which needs a new birth and a fresh beginning. As a Westerner I must begin where I stand within my own culture and its customs. this is the the Christian Mystics come in. We in the West must take these insights into our hearts regularly, permit them to play in the heart, And then take them into our work and citizenship and as well as community. this is one way all healthy and deep awakenings happen; they start with the heart and flow out from there.\r\n\r\nThe crises we find ourselves in as a species require that as a species we shake up all our institutions including our religious ones and reinvent them. Change is needed for our survival, And we often turn to the mystics at critical times like this. Jung considered that: The mystics bring what is creative to religion itself. Jesus was a mystic shaking up his religion and the Roman empire; Buddha was a mystic who shook up the customary Hinduism of his day; Gandhi was a mystic shaking up Hinduism and rough the British empire; And Martin Luther king Jr. Shook up his norm and America segregationist society. The mystics walk any talk and talk (Often in significant poetic phraseology) their particular walk. She posits an erotic affectionate between the Divine and nature when she says: The Creator loves his transformation, So birth loves the creator. formation, also, Was designed to be adorned, To be bathed, To be gifted with all the current love of the creator. the entire world has been embraced by this kiss. Bede Griffiths was an English Benedictine monk who spent 50 years in India living and coming up to an ashram that was Christian and, people, Hindu. He wrote a number of books on the coming together of Eastern and [url=http://www.bestdatingreviews.org/datingsites/CharmDate]charmdate review[/url] Western mysticism. He shares knowledge:\r\n\r\nit's the deepest impression left by life in India, The sense of the sacred as something pervading the order of nature. Every hill and tree and lake is holy, And the simplest human acts of consuming meals, Still more of birth and matrimony, Have all retained their sacred attitude. It is there that the West need to learn form the East the sense of the of a transcendent mystery which is immanent in everything and which gives an ultimate meaning to life Berry was an American priest in the Passionist Order who called himself a A student of world religions and of recent science, He was a great ecological prophet as is clear in his books, The Dream of the world and The Great Work, Where he warns of the work we must do to reinvent our instructional, money, Political and religious systems if we are to be a environmentally safe species on this endangered planet. He produces:\r\n\r\nHuman venture depends absolutely on this quality of awe and reverence and joy in the planet and all that lives and grows upon the planet. In the end the universe can only be explained as to celebration. It is all an exuberant expression of existence itself A way is opening for each individual to receive the total spiritual heritage of the human community as well as the total spiritual heritage of the universe. Within this context the religious antagonisms of the past can be overcome, that traditions can be vitalized, And the sense of presence to a sacred universe can appear once more to dynamize and sustain human affairs. all the way down, most of us is a mystic. When we make use of that energy we become alive again and we give birth. From the creativity that we release is born the prophetic vision and work that we all aspire to realize as our gift anywhere int he planet. we would like to serve in whatever capacity we can. getting in contact with the mystic inside is the beginning of our deep service. Visit Matthew Fox for the internet.\r\n\r\nSNK and the Nuclear deterrent\r\n\r\nI sure I not the first to say this, But doesn the power to unleash the Wall Titans seem very much like a nuclear deterrent?\r\n\r\nThe invasion of Paradis on the grounds of eliminating the Wall Titan threat and the enormous loss of life and lack of any real gain might be seen as analogous to the invasion of Iraq by the Western powers on the grounds of suspected nuclear development. Marley want singular prominence over the Titan power, Just as the West want novel control over the nuclear.\r\n\r\nAnd the hand of friendship Hizuru extends is in order to leverage on Paradis material resources before they can appreciate their true value, similar to the much sought and much exploited oil fields of the Middle East.\r\n\r\nSNK has always had a great deal to say about war and gradually growing number of about politics. Marley isn't just based on Nazi Germany, But any huge invasive superpower. And as history has also shown with the likes of the USSR and North Korea deeply problematic regimes but still ones that sought/seek independence from Western dominance the most trusted way to preserve that independence is the nuclear deterrent, As Paradis are finding now.\r\n\r\nThis in itself presents many differenet moral problems, Gambling the fate around the world on a national argument. Yet the desire for independence is not to be easily dismissed, any. as always, This series is true to life even without the any easy answers."
