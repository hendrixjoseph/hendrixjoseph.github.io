message: "Unrelated to the previous shutdown, I received another email from Amazon:\r\n\r\n> From: Amazon Associates<br />\r\n> To: Me<br />\r\n> Date: Wednesday, April 17, 2019 10:55 am<br />\r\n> Subject: Your Amazon.com Associates Account<br />\r\n> \r\n> Hello hendrixjoseph-20,\r\n> \r\n> Effective in 7 days, Amazon is terminating your Associates account as well as the Operating Agreement that governs it.\r\n> \r\n> **Note that this communication is regarding only the account listed in the subject line of this email.**\r\n> \r\n> **Why?**<br />\r\n> You haven’t referred any qualifying sales for more than 365 days.\r\n> \r\n> **What’s next?**<br />\r\n> You must stop using the Content and Amazon Marks and promptly remove all links to the Amazon site. You will be paid on the regular schedule for any outstanding fees that have accrued prior to this notice.\r\n> \r\n> You are welcome to reapply at any time by visiting https://affiliate-program.amazon.com.\r\n> \r\n> Thank you for your participation in the Amazon Associates Program.\r\n> \r\n> Amazon.com\r\n\r\nWhile I don't make a ton of referrals, the last referral was in January of this year, way less than 365 days ago. I responded to Amazon's email last night:\r\n\r\n> Hello,\r\n> \r\n> I received an email stating that \"Effective in 7 days, Amazon is terminating your Associates account\" because I \"haven’t referred any qualifying sales for more than 365 days.\"\r\n> \r\n> However, the last time I referred a sale was January 29, 2019, which is much less than 365 days.\r\n> \r\n> I was wondering if the email was sent in error, or if there is something else I need to do.\r\n> \r\n> Thank you,\r\n> \r\n> Joe Hendrix\r\n\r\nI've yet to hear anything. We'll see if I do get shut down again or if nothing happens."
