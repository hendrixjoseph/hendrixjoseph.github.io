message: "I wonder if they are intentionally vague in their wording of these warnings. I have to go to battle with them shortly myself--mine says that my information is not current (re: sites listed in the Associates account, etc.).  The warning was today, so I at least have part of today and all day tomorrow to figure it out (as I don't expect much movement over the weekend). \r\n\r\nIt would help if they could assign us a case number as well--per your experience, it seems like they have random employees/contractors looking at the sites and making judgment calls on their own. I may try the chat, although I don't hold out much hope.  I'm afraid to call, as I don't know if the call still ends up in the US or is offshored to employees who can barely understand English."
