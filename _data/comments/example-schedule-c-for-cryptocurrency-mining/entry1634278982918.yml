  Code 541510 isn't in NAICS.  Technically it's just 5415.  There is a 541519
  code that is just "Other Computer Related Services" that is likely applicable
  under the 5415 code.  I'd use this or 518210 code.  I'll likely use 541519 as
  it's broad and can cover other income I may make in computers (selling compute
  resources, etc).
