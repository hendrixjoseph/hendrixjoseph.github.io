  You need to measure the output of the computer with a kill-a-watt or similar. 
  A power supply will only draw the amount of watts as the equipment attached,
  and will typically be a lot lower than the rating of the power supply.  For
  example, on my rig, I use a 1000 watt power supply, but the GPUs and
  Motherboard/CPU only consume around 267 watts when mining.  You are almost
  definitely overestimating your power use and thus your expenses.  Unless you
  have enough equipment attached to max out your power supply that is.  Either
  way, the correct way to do it is measure the actual usage, a kill-a-watt is
  cheap.
