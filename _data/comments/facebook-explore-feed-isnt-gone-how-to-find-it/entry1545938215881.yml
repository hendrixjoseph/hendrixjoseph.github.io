msg: "Today, I went to the beach with my kids. I found a \r\nsea shell and gave it to my 4 year old daughter and said \r\n\"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She placed the shell to \r\nher ear and screamed. There was a hermit crab inside and it pinched her ear.\r\nShe never wants to go back! LoL I know this is completely off topic \r\nbut I had to tell someone!"
