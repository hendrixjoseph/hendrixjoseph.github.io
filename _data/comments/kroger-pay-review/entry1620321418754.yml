  I have a Kroger credit card and I also use their Scan Bag & Go system. If I
  choose to use Kroger Pay (first) the barcode for SBG never appears again,
  their system assumes I will be scanning all my items. If I scan the SBG
  barcode first then I end up at the end trying Kroger Pay and of course it
  fails. The self checkout attendants have no clue what to do and are not
  trained. So I went back in the store and bought a couple items I forgot and
  scanned my Kroger Pay QR code first, scanned my items but never saw the
  “Mobile” icon but hit Kroger Pay....”Processing” rejected ....go back. Epic
  fail. I end up using my Kroger credit card in their card reader and the
  transaction works fine. On my receipt is a decline for the Kroger Pay attempt
  then a successful charge for the card reader attempt. My assumption is the
  process I followed was declined because the chip on the credit card was not
  read. The Mobile pay icon probably bypasses the chip on the card to record the
  charge. If they only trained their people ..... I refuse to use Kroger Pay.
