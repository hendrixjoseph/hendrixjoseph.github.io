## Why Write a Calorie to Exercise Calculator?

The other day I was somewhere around 60 calories over my calorie goal. Not much, really, and maybe within the margin of error considering how inaccurate my recording can be.

But I thought to myself *What exercise - and for how long - could I do to burn that 60 calories?* With sites and apps like [My Fitness Pal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/) I *could* select an exercise, and then increase or decrease the time until I found how long it would take to burn 60 calories.

But not only is that time-consuming - it's only looking at one exercise at a time. Which, I suppose, just means it would even be more time consuming to look at several different exercises until I found one that I could do in a certain amount of time.

I'm a software engineer (aka programmer) by trade, so I decided I'd do a bit of research. It turns out that each exercise has a number associated with it called a [metabolic equivalent of task](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_equivalent_of_task), or MET. If you know an exercise's MET, plus a few other bits of information, you can figure out how many calories an exercise burns.

Here's the equation:

    METs × 3.5 × body weight in kilograms / 200 = Kcal/min

Keep in mind that **kilocalories** are the same as capital-C **Calories**.

Solving the equation for minutes is straight forward:

    min = Kcal / (METs × 3.5 × body weight in kilograms / 200)

So all I need to know is how many calories I want to burn, and how much I weigh, and I can figure out how long I have to exercise for each exercise to burn that many calories. And with exercises that involve a speed - such as running or walking - I can also figure out how far I need to go.

*Fun fact: there are MET values for things that aren't commonly thought of as exercises as well, including [inactivty](https://sites.google.com/site/compendiumofphysicalactivities/Activity-Categories/inactivity) and yes, [sexual activity](https://sites.google.com/site/compendiumofphysicalactivities/Activity-Categories/sexual-activity).*

I'm unsure if My Fitness Pal or similar apps use METs, but it would make sense if they did. Why reinvent the wheel?
