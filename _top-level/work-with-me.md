Simply put, I like building things. I excel at creating maintainable, easy-to-modify software that performs.

While I call myself a "generalist" and "full-stack developer" and am interested in, well, *everything*, my expertise is in Java and JavaScript frameworks, especially Spring and Angular.

I also excel at SQL and relational databases; I've used Microsoft SQL Server, PostGreSQL, MySQL, and Oracle.

Check out my resume either in [PDF format](https://www.joehxblog.com/pdfs/hendrix-resume.pdf) (if you want to print it) or in [HTML format](https://www.joehxblog.com/resume/). The PDF format is more succinct.
