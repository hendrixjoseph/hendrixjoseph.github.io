title: Interesting Reads for the Week Ending August 20th
tags: [interesting reads]
---

It's Friday and it's the twentieth. Here's what I read that I found interesting over the past week.

## The Rules

Here are the rules for what articles I choose to include in this weekly roundup:

1. It can't be anything I wrote.
2. It has to be something I actually read. Nothing that simply had an interesting headline.
3. I have to have read it since the previous post. It does not have to be something that was written in the past week.
4. It has to be something I read online. In other words, it has to be a webpage with a URL.

## The Reads

If the chip on your card ever fails and you're forced to swipe it - then you'll be out of luck in a few years because [MasterCard To Discontinue Magnetic Stripes By 2024-2033](https://www.doctorofcredit.com/mastercard-to-discontinue-magnetic-stripes-by-2024-2033/).

I've recently been reading up on GANs - Generative Adversarial Networks. [12 Colab Notebooks that matter](https://towardsdatascience.com/12-colab-notebooks-that-matter-e14ce1e3bdd0) is a list of a dozen GAN Google Collab notebooks that seem interesting.

This spoke to me - [Our Kindergartener's Teacher Told Us to Limit Her Reading So She Wonâ€™t "Get Too Far Ahead"](https://slate.com/human-interest/2021/08/kindergarten-advanced-reader-limit-parenting-advice-from-care-and-feeding.html). While I never had a teacher tell my parents to limit my reading, I do remember always reading ahead whenever we were reading a book out loud in class. I just couldn't *not* read ahead when my classmates read _s_o_ _s_l_o_w_.

People have more than the five classical senses. That's the point of the article [How many senses do you have? A lot more than 5, says science](https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/how-many-senses-do-we-have/). I've known this a while - we also have the sense of time, the sense of temperature, the sense of balance - so I call the five senses - smell, sight, touch, taste, and hearing - the five "classical" senses because these were the senses identified in antiquity by none other than Aristotle.
