For the month of May, I only read one book, which seems to be the trend for the year. While I did read [three books in January]({{ site.url }}/january-2018-book-reading-list/), I only managed to read [one book in March]({{ site.url }}/march-2018-book-reading-list/) and [one book in April]({{ site.url }}/april-2018-book-reading-list/).

One book a month is still better than [last year, where I only read five books]({{ site.url }}/the-5-books-i-read-in-2017/).

Continuing with the theme of the year (that theme is being a new dad) I read 
[The Complete Idiot's Guide to Being a New Dad](https://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/2462910/77416/2029?u=https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9781615642472/22914225642). I was actually rather disappointed with this book. It's not that it was a bad book, it's just that it didn't get to actual parenting until chapter 8. The first seven chapters dealt with pregnancy.

There's nothing inherently wrong with a book about being a new dad dealing with the ins and outs of pregnancy. However, my wife gave birth to our baby boy at the end of March, so we've already been through pregnancy and birth. What I was wanting is advice on how to deal with having a child and being a father.

## Children's Books

I'm continuing to read to my son. I'm not sure how much he can appreciate and enjoy it right now. He does watch me intently when I'm reading, though.

Reading is probably good for him beyond a literacy standpoint. I tend to be a quiet person, so I often can't think of things to say. Reading to him forces me to talk and allows him to hear a wider range of sounds and vocabulary than he would otherwise.

I read him two new books this month:

* [I Love You, Dad (Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood)](https://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/2462910/77416/2029?u=https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9781481457361/30231258092)
* [Daddy Kisses by Anne Gutman](https://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/2462910/77416/2029?u=https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9780811839143/30051600703)

Notice a theme with these two books? :)

I also re-read a book to him from last month:

* [Snuggle Puppy!](https://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/2462910/77416/2029?u=https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9780761130673/22580693203)

He's slowly getting more interactive - he smiles occasionally and is able to hold is head up longer. He will look and me and will follow things with his eyes. I like to hold a burp clothe above his head and swing it back and forth. In turn, he likes watching it swing back and forth.

He's cooing - it's so cute! I think I even got him to laugh last night!
