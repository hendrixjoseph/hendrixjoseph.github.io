Another month in the books. And speaking of books...

Last month in November I read 18 different books to my son and 10 different books to my daughter.

I only read one book for me, though. Granted, I only had three of November's four weeks due to [our trip to Ireland](https://www.joehxblog.com/our-ireland-2021-trip/).

## The Books I Read for Me

I read the last and final book in the [Harry Potter saga](https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Paperback-Box-Books/dp/0545162076/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20): [Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows](https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Deathly-Hallows-Rowling-ebook/dp/B0192CTMWS/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20).

I never read the books before - not even when they first came out twenty or thirty years ago. I have seen most of [the movies](https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-8-Film-Collection-Various/dp/B08TR1FJ1F/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) - perhaps now that I've finished the books, I should move on to [the movies](https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-8-Film-Collection-Various/dp/B08TR1FJ1F/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20)?
