title: ChatGPT Mac and Cheese
tags: [chatgpt, cooking]

The other day my daughter wanted macaroni and cheese for lunch. However, we didn't have any macaroni and cheese with the pre-made cheese mix.

What we *did* have was macaroni noodles on their own, along with shredded cheddar cheese.

So I asked ChatGPT the following question:

> If I just have elbow macaroni, shredded cheddar cheese, milk, and maybe a few other ingredients, how can I make macaroni and cheese?

And here's how it responded:

> You can make a simple stovetop macaroni and cheese with just those ingredients. Here's how:
>
> ## Ingredients:
>
> * 2 cups elbow macaroni
> * 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese
> * 1 cup milk (whole or 2% works best)
> * 2 tbsp butter (optional but recommended)
> * Salt and pepper to taste
>
> ## Instructions:
>
> 1. Cook the Pasta:
>
>    Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the elbow macaroni according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.
>
> 2. Make the Cheese Sauce:
>
>    * In the same pot (or a separate one), melt the butter over medium heat (if using).
>    * Add the milk and heat it until warm but not boiling.
>    * Slowly add the shredded cheddar cheese, stirring constantly until it melts into a smooth sauce.
>
> 3. Combine:
>
>    * Add the cooked macaroni back into the pot and stir to coat it with the cheese sauce.
>    * Season with salt and pepper to taste.
>
> 4. Serve:
>
>    Enjoy your homemade mac and cheese while it's warm!
>
> ## Optional Add-ins:
>
> * A pinch of garlic powder or mustard powder for extra flavor.
> * A bit of flour (about 1 tbsp) mixed with butter before adding milk to thicken the sauce.
> * A splash of hot sauce or paprika for a little kick.

So I was still able to make my daughter some mac and cheese. And I thought it was good. I did add some a little flour like it suggested to thicken the sauce; I didn't add the other addins because, well, my daughter is only five and wouldn't appreciate her mac and cheese being even a little bit spicy.

Of course, the most important judge of whether it was good or not is was my daughter herself. And she said she liked it!
