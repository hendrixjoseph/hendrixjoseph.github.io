It's now the eleventh. This is quite possibly the latest I've ever posted my monthly *Book Reading List*.

Sadly, I only managed to read my son one book. He's six now, and literate, so he can read to himself.

I did read eleven books to my four-year-old daughter.

Oh, and I read two books for myself.

## Books I Read to My Children

### The Book I Read to My Son

The only book I read to my son was [Once Upon a Cool Motorcycle Dude](https://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/2462910/77416/2029?u=https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?tn=Once Upon a Cool Motorcycle Dude).

He's read plenty of books to himself, though.

And the eleven books I read to my daughter are:
