I’ve been living in a pink house since 2007. Well no more! I didn’t move - I painted my house the other day. Now I live in a brown house! The awesomest part is I only spent about $40 and it only took us maybe six hours? Just the better part of the afternoon. 

Here are before and after photos:

*The house after - it's brown!*

Until next time
