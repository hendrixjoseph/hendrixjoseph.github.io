I thought this was just awesome. Remember the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time for the Nintendo 64? Well, it’s just gotten an HD makeover. Sadly, it’s not the folks over at Nintendo that did this, it’s just a hack. Which means if you want to play it in HD, you'll have to, well, download it...

*Zelda HD*

Anyway, [here's a site that shows you the difference as well as tells you how to install this on your own](https://web.archive.org/web/20110628012126/http://www.lanpartyguide.com/zelda/). Enjoy!

Until next time
