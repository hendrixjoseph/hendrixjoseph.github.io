The twentieth is a special time here on the blog. It's a time where I go to the various analytic sites and gather up the statistics so I can have an understanding of how this blog is doing.

Except I've been lazy over the past month and only published one post:

* [September 2021 Book Reading List](https://www.joehxblog.com/september-2021-book-reading-list/)

I'm going to continue being lazy and just drop the numbers this month.
