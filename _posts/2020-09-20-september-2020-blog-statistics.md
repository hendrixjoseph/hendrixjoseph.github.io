This month the twentieth falls on a Sunday. Which means I'm writing this blog stats post while my kids are napping.

Over the past month I wrote five blog posts:

* [Preview SVG Files in Windows Explorer with Microsoft PowerToys](https://www.joehxblog.com/preview-svg-files-in-windows-explorer-with-microsoft-powertoys/)
* [GitHub Actions: Tag Page Generator for Jekyll Blogs](https://www.joehxblog.com/github-actions-tag-page-generator-for-jekyll-blogs/)
* [August 2020 Book Reading List](https://www.joehxblog.com/august-2020-book-reading-list/)
* [My First Android App: Tagger for Amazon Associates](https://www.joehxblog.com/my-first-android-app-tagger-for-amazon-associates/)
* [Using a Threat Matrix for Decision Making](https://www.joehxblog.com/using-a-threat-matrix-for-decision-making/)

## Alexa

My Alexa rank dropped over a million points, and is now over three million - and almost four million! That sucks, but oh well. The blog *is* making more money than it did when the Alexa rank was last under a million back in [February of this year](https://www.joehxblog.com/february-2020-blog-statistics/):

* Global Rank &rarr; 3,872,598

## Google Analytics

* Sessions &rarr; 778
* Users &rarr; 685

## AdSense

I have less than ten bucks to go to be able to cash out of my AdSense earnings. It's only been, what, five years since the [first post on this iteration of my blog](https://www.joehxblog.com/java_se7_certificate/)?

* Balance &rarr; $91.19
* Estimated earnings &rarr; $2.72
* Impressions &rarr; 1,415
* Clicks &rarr; 9

## Moz Stats

I've changed the name of the heading of this section and added *Moz Linking Domains* as a stat. I was able to get historical data from Moz and add it to my [blog stats spreadsheet](https://github.com/hendrixjoseph/hendrixjoseph.github.io/blob/master/_data/blog-stats.csv).

* Moz Domain Authority &rarr; 30
* Moz Linking Domains &rarr; 525

## Ratios

* Earnings / 1,000 sessions = $2.72 / 0.778 = $3.50
* Earnings / 1,000 pageviews = $2.72 / 1.047 = $2.60
* Earnings / 1,000 impressions = $2.72 / 1.415 = $1.92
* Earnings / day = $2.72 / 31 = $0.09
* Sessions / day = 778 / 31= 25.1
* Pageviews / day = 1,047 / 31 = 33.8
* Impressions / day = 1,415 / 31 = 45.6
