June is over. The year is officially half over.

For whatever reason, June was a slow month reading-wise - at least compared to other months. I only managed to read 12 books to my son and 9 books to my daughter.

And I only finished one book for myself.

## The Books I Read for Me

The only book I finished last month was [The Lost World: Jurassic Park](https://www.amazon.com/Lost-World-Novel-Jurassic-Park-ebook/dp/B000FC1J76/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20).

I started another book - a non-fiction book - but I don't think I'm going to finish that one. Instead I'm going to pick up a different non-fiction book.

What books are they? Stay tuned to next month in order to find out!
