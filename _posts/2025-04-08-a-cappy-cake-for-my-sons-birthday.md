This year my son wanted a Cappy cake for his birthday. Who or what is Cappy? Cappy is Mario's hat from [Super Mario Odysey](https://www.amazon.com/Super-Mario-Odyssey-US-Version-Switch/dp/B01MY7GHKJ/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20).

He's not just Mario's hat - he's a living hat that takes the form of Mario's hat for the duration of the game.

Making the cake wasn't that complex. I baked four 9-inch round cakes (which took a total of two boxes of cake mix). The bottom part of the cake was two round parts, with one of the two cut so the could fit together. The top two parts laid on top of one another. Between each layer I added icing to help keep that parts together.

The icing? Some plain white icing, some vanilla icing - three containers total - with a ton of red food dye. Before putting the icing on the cake, I softened it in the microwave.

The eyes came from some leftover fondant from [my daughter's Rapunzel Cake](https://www.joehxblog.com/a-rapunzel-cake-for-my-daughters-birthday/). The iris - the colored part of the eye - came from some decorative candy eyeballs I bought at Kroger. I colored them using the icing already on the cake - I tried to color them with the food dye at first, but that ended up washing away the black part of the iris.

And here's the finished product:
