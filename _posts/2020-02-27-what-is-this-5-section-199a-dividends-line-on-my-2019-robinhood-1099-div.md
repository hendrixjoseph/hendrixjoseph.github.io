Robinhood messed up. Or maybe it was the government. But in either case, Robinhood ended up sending me two sets of 1099s this year - an original one, and a "corrected" one.

> Well, they actually sent me three - "Robinhood Crypto" sent me one, whereas "Robinhood Securities" sent me the two.

What confused me was this "5- Section 199A dividends" line:

![My 2019 Robinhood 1099-DIV](/images/robinhood/2019-1099-div.png)
*My 2019 Robinhood 1099-DIV*

On the original [1099-DIV](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-div) it didn't matter since the line had a value of $0.00. But the corrected value has a value of $1.55.

Does this mean I have to pay extra tax on this buck-fifty-five? Or perhaps... Less?

It turns out the answer is technically neither (the buck-fifty-five was not enough to affect my taxes) *but* if it were five or more dollars, I would have ended up owing less tax.

> This buck-fifty-five "Section 199A dividends" was from a couple of shares of REIT called New Residential Investment (NRZ), which I picked up the first share back in [November 2018](https://www.joehxblog.com/my-robinhood-stock-picks-for-november-2018/).

It turns out I report this buck-fifty-five on line 6 of [IRS Form 8995](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8995).

Line six reads:

> 6 Qualified REIT dividends and publicly traded partnership (PTP) income or (loss) (see instructions)

The [instructions for line six](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i8995#idm139766571122832) merely read "Enter income as a positive number and losses as a negative number" - however, there is [this section earlier in the instructions](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i8995#idm139766602610064):

>## Determining Your Qualified REIT Dividends and Qualified PTP Income/ Loss 
>
> Qualified REIT dividends include any dividends you received from a REIT held for more than 45 days and for which the payment isn’t obligated to someone else and that isn’t a capital gain dividend or qualified dividend, plus your qualified REIT dividends received from a regulated investment company (RIC). This amount is reported to you on Form 1099-DIV, line 5.

See that last bit? **This amount is reported to you on Form 1099-DIV, line 5.** That's what I'm looking for!

It turns out I get to deduct from my income 20% of the "qualified REIT dividends" I received. This was new last year ([Tax Cuts & Jobs Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Cuts_and_Jobs_Act_of_2017) thing) and form 8995 is a new form for this year (last year it was a worksheet that you didn't file).

Lines six through seven of Form 8995 help you calculate how much you can deduct:

> 6 Qualified REIT dividends and publicly traded partnership (PTP) income or (loss) (see instructions)
>
> 7 Qualified REIT dividends and qualified PTP (loss) carryforward from the prior year
>
> 8 Total qualified REIT dividends and PTP income. Combine lines 6 and 7. If zero or less, enter -0- 
>
> 9 REIT and PTP component. Multiply line 8 by 20% (0.20)

Everything is rounded to the nearest dollar, so my $1.55 becomes $2.00, and 20% of two bucks is $0.40 - which, being rounded to the nearest dollar, is a big fat zero.

In other words, the following are lines six through nine for me:

![My Form 8995, Lines 6, 7, 8, and 9](/images/robinhood/2019-form-8995-lines-6-7-8-9.png)
*My Form 8995, Lines 6, 7, 8, and 9*

So I get no extra deductions for my buck-and-a-half of qualified REIT dividends.
