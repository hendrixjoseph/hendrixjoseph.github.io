Chugging along in this pandemic apocalypse, reading book after book.

## Books I Read to My Children

A lot of times when I'm reading something to my daughter, my now two-year son just *has* to come to be read to, as well.

I don't mind. I actually like it!

## The Book I Read for Me

What I read (& finished) in April was [The Reckoning: A Time Travel Thriller](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B084Q9QVNT/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20).

I have a couple of thoughts on this book.

First, I could tell that interpersonal communication was written from a women's perspective. For instance, the characters understood each other without directly being told - e.g. just by a facial expression. This isn't a bad thing - in fact, it's a good thing - and was quite interesting to read. If anything, it's an argument to read from a variety of authors.

The other thought I had is it seemed to end rather abruptly. Not quite a [deus ex machina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_ex_machina) ending - but everything is quickly resolved. I don't want to say exactly what happens, because, you know, spoilers.
