Welcome to the start of the fourth year of my monthly book reading lists. That's right - I published the first reading list all the way back in [January 2018](https://www.joehxblog.com/january-2018-book-reading-list/).

Oddly enough, this is only my 36th post - it *would* be my 37th (12 * 3 + 1 = 37) but I missed February 2018. I blame that on [my son being born](https://www.joehxblog.com/life-update/) in March 2018 - although I didn't use that excuse for my [December 2019 book reading list](https://www.joehxblog.com/december-2019-book-reading-list/) when my daughter was born!

## Books I Read to My Children

### Books I Read to My Son

I read 41 different books to my son. I would have read more (different) books, but he's starting to want the same books read to him repeatedly.

He really likes the books by [P.D. Eastman](http://pdeastmanbooks.com/).  You'll also notice a theme of poop in a few of the books below - while he can go pee in the potty, he's reluctant to go poop in the potty. We're trying to get him used to the idea of pooping in a toilet.

### Books I Read to My Daughter

I read 19 different books to my daughter.

What's new with my daughter this month, in regards to books, is twofold: she's started looking at books on her own, and she'll bring me books to read to her.

What's new with my daughter this month, *not* in regards to books, is that she's starting taking steps. She's not full-on walking yet, but she most certainly will by the time I post my next book reading list.

## The Book I Read for Me

I finally finished that textbook on local government I've been reading for the past few months, so I can finally name that book: [State and Local Government 8th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0495802654/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20).

![The cover of State and Local Government 8th Edition by Ann Bowman and Richard Kearney](/images/books/covers/state-and-local-government-8th-edition.jpg)
*The cover of State and Local Government 8th Edition by Ann Bowman and Richard C. Kearney*

I decided on this particular book by seeing what was the required textbook for a course on local government at a local community college. That course was [PLS 1232 State & Local Government](https://catalog.sinclair.edu/courses/PLS/1232) at [Sinclair Community College](https://www.sinclair.edu/).

They're using the [10th edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/130538847X/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) - I chose the 8th edition because it was much cheaper. I paid about seven bucks - as opposed to the almost sixty bucks the [ninth](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1435462688/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) and tenth editions costs right now. (Of course, all these prices are subject to change, especially as more editions come out.)

My review of the book? It was decidedly pro-government biased (it even says so on the back cover - saying that the book has a "pro public-service stance"), as well as biased liberally and towards the Democratic Party. It used a lot of idioms, so non-English speakers may have difficulty understanding parts of it, especially when it goes back and forth referring to states by their name and their nickname (e.g. referring to Ohio either as "Ohio" or "the Buckeye State"). I think the best (most hilarious) simile it used was "it is as tangled and intricate as the webs of a thousand spiders on methamphetamines."

Onto the next book - which will probably be the next book in [the Cluster Series](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07G2235FK/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) that I'm reading on my [Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=kindle&tag=hendrixjoseph-20).
