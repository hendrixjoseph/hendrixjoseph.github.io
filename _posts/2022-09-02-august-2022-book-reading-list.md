## The Books I Read for Me

As I have been doing for awhile, I alternate between fiction and non-fiction books. Since last month I read a non-fiction book, this month I started with a fiction book.

So I picked up [Ready Player One](https://www.amazon.com/Ready-Player-One-Ernest-Cline-ebook/dp/B004J4WKUQ/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). Other than the overall plot, it was quite different than [the movie of the same name](https://www.amazon.com/Ready-Player-One-Tye-Sheridan/dp/B07BDRR6S1/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20).

Next, I picked up a non-fiction book - [Crucial Conversations Tools for Talking When Stakes Are High](https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Conversations-Talking-Stakes-Second-ebook/dp/B005K0AYH4/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). I'm not sure I got a lot out of it - I don't have a lot of the high-stakes, high-emotion conversations described in the book. Nevertheless, it was a quick and easy read.
