It's the twentieth. And as I've been doing for 39 posts now, it's time for my monthly blog stat reports.

I've been focusing more on [my campaign site](https://joe4huberheights.com), so I haven't spent the time I normally do on this site.

That said, I did write three posts this month:

The three posts I wrote this month are:

* [No-Shave Winter - 121 Selfies Across 121 Days](https://www.joehxblog.com/no-shave-winter/)
* [February 2021 Book Reading List](https://www.joehxblog.com/february-2021-book-reading-list/)
* [3D Colorspace Geometry](https://www.joehxblog.com/3d-colorspace-geometry/)

## Alexa

Last month, my Alexa rank was under a million. Now it's back over a million:

* Global Rank &rarr; 1,273,337

## Google Analytics

Nothing special here, other than consistant views:

* Sessions &rarr; 4,502
* Users &rarr; 4,000
* Pageviews &rarr; 5,237

## AdSense

My ad serving has been limited once again. This is the third time in the past three months.

The first time was from December 19th through December 30th - 11 days.

The second time was from January 22nd through February 6th - 15 days.

This time it started on March 4th. It looks as if it may have lifted as of March 18th (so 14 days) but their still is the following warning at the top of my AdSense console:

{% include image.html src="/images/blog-stats/2021/03/ads-limited-message.png" caption="The warning box that says: &quot;The number of ads you can show has been limited. For details, go to the Policy center.&quot;" %}

It seems I'm not alone in this - there's a couple of reddit threads (one on [/r/juststart/ on 3/7/2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/lzprwu/the_number_of_ads_you_can_show_has_been_limited/) and one on [/r/Adsense/ at 3/18/2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adsense/comments/m0qkz8/ad_serving_limit_placed_on_my_adsense_accountagain/)) where people are complaining of the same thing.

No one knows exactly why, but everyone is assuming it's a problem with Google's AI.

* Balance &rarr; $129.43
* Estimated earnings &rarr; $55.08
* Impressions &rarr; 7,272
