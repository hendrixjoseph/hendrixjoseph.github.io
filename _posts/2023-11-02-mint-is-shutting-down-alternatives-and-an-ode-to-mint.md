title: Mint is Shutting Down; Alternatives & an Ode to Mint

Mint, the personal finance app, has announced [they're shutting down January 1st, 2014](https://mint.intuit.com/blog/mint-app-news/intuit-credit-karma-welcomes-minters/).

Now I've been using Intuit products for a while now (I love the TurboTax [Taxcaster](https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/calculators/taxcaster/) tool), and Mint has been a staple in my day-to-day financial management. I've been using Mint a long time. The first transaction I have in there is a tuition payment of $1,830 to Wright State University on August 15th, 2014. But I've been using it longer than that - since before it was Mint - when it was called [PageOnce](https://techcrunch.com/2008/06/02/one-stop-account-manager-pageonce-launches/). Back then it was meant to aggregate all your feeds, not just money feeds. Feed from your email, Facebook, and even MySpace.

## Alternatives to Mint?

I haven't vetted any of these. Some of these may cost money. And they don't necessarily have a 100% overlap with the functionality of Mint.

But here are some alternatives to Mint that I've seen discussed around the internet:

* [Copilot](https://copilot.money/) - not a web application, but only available for iPhone and Mac
* [Empower](https://www.empower.com/) - formally Personal Capital
* [Fidelity Full View](https://www.fidelity.com/spend-save/full-view/overview)
* [Monarch Money](https://www.monarchmoney.com/) - made by former Mint people
* [Moneydance](https://moneydance.com/) by Infinite Kind, also not a web app, but available for Windows, Linux, & Android in addition to iPhone and Mac.
* [Rocket Money](https://www.rocketmoney.com/)
* [Simplifi](https://app.simplifimoney.com/) - owned by Quicken
* [Tiller](https://www.tillerhq.com/) - embeds into a Google Sheet or Excel Spreadsheet
* [Wealth Position ](https://www.wealthposition.com/home)
* [YNAB](https://www.ynab.com/) aka "You Need a Budget"

Supposedly [Credit Karma](https://www.creditkarma.com/) has (or will have?) transation tracking, but I haven't been able to find it.

## An Ode to Mint

> Oh, Mint, dear friend of mine, now fading into the night,<br />
> For nearly a decade, you've been my guiding financial light.<br />
> From PageOnce's inception, through name changes and through years,<br />
> You've helped me track my spending, calmed my financial fears.<br />
> 
> In two thousand fourteen, on an August summer's day,<br />
> I made my first transaction, a tuition I had to pay,<br />
> To Wright State University, a chapter of my life,<br />
> You were there to document it, my trusted digital rife.<br />
> 
> Through ups and downs, you've been my constant companion,<br />
> Keeping tabs on budgets, expenses, and plans for expansion.<br />
> With every click and tap, you helped me stay on track,<br />
> To navigate the twists and turns, there's nothing that I lack.<br />
> 
> You used to aggregated social feeds, emails, and more,<br />
> But it's your financial prowess that I truly adore.<br />
> A dashboard filled with data, transactions plain to see,<br />
> You've been the key to my financial harmony.<br />
> 
> But now, the time has come to bid you our farewell,<br />
> As January 1, 2023, rings its solemn knell.<br />
> I'll miss your insights and your ever-watchful eye,<br />
> As you gracefully bow out, and our tears we'll try to dry.<br />
> 
> Oh, Mint, you've been a faithful, trusted friend,<br />
> From PageOnce's early days until this bittersweet end.<br />
> Though you may fade away, your memory will persist,<br />
> A chapter in my financial journey that I'll never resist.<br />
> 
> So, here's to you, Mint, in this heartfelt ode I send,<br />
> A farewell to a dear companion, a true and loyal friend.<br />
> You'll be missed, but the lessons learned will always stay,<br />
> As I navigate the future, in a different, mint-less way.<br />
