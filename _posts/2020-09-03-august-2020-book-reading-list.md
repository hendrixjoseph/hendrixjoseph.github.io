Reading keeps getting better month after month. I read more to both my son and my daughter, and twice as many books for myself than I did [last month](https://www.joehxblog.com/july-2020-book-reading-list/).

## Books I Read to My Children

### Books I Read to My Son

I read thirty - that's 30! - different books to my son last month. He can't even count to thirty yet. Twenty, maybe twenty-nine before he continues to twenty-ten.

Thirty!

### Books I Read to My Daughter

I read less than half as many books to my daughter last month as I did to my son.

That's right - I read fourteen different books to my daughter last month.

## Books I Read for Me

I did good for me, too. I read two books versus my normal one.

Well, I finished two books. The first I read mostly in July - I finished it in the first few days of August.

The first book I finished was [Potty Training For Dummies](https://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/2462910/77416/2029?u=https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9780764554179). Yep, we're working on potty training my son!

The book I started and finished in August was [Human Nature by Finlay Borthwick](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07M6S9WM2/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). I want to say it wasn't a well-written book - the motivation for the characters seemed wanting - but it was an easy read, which made it enjoyable.

Until next time.
