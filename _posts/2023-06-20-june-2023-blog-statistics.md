Duh duh duuh. Another blog stats post. Because it's the twentieth!

Here are those three posts:

* [April 2023 Book Reading List](https://www.joehxblog.com/may-2023-book-reading-list/)

* Earnings / 1,000 impressions = $36.64 / 27.48 = $1.33
* Earnings / day = $36.64 / 31 = $1.18
* Users / day = 5,300 / 31 = 171.0 
* Impressions / day = 27,480 / 31 = 886.5
