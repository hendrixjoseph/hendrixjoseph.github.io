It's been a busy month - Christmas, New Years, and [a new baby](https://twitter.com/JoeHxBlog/status/1211377937238364162).

As such, I was only able to publish three posts this month:

* [Android Spinner (Drop-Down List) SpinnerAdapter Problem: ArrayAdapter requires the resource ID to be a TextView](https://www.joehxblog.com/android-spinner-spinneradapter-problem-arrayadapter-requires-the-resource-id-to-be-a-textview/)
* [December 2019 Book Reading List](https://www.joehxblog.com/december-2019-book-reading-list/)
* [2019 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2019-end-of-year-side-income-report/)

## Alexa

My Alexa ranking has gotten worse over the past month. I'll assume that's because I haven't been able to work on the blog as much. 

* Global Rank &rarr; 312,868
* Rank in the United States &rarr; 149,540
* Total Sites Linking In &rarr; 4

My old domain  is starting to lose "total sites linking in." Last month it was at 61 - this month it's at 57.

## Google Analytics

* Sessions &rarr; 1,308
* Users &rarr; 1,230
* Pageviews &rarr; 1,602

## Google Search Console

There's not much going on for the old domain on Google Search Console, so I'll omit that from the reports from here on out. I'll keep updating [the blog stats spreadsheet](https://github.com/hendrixjoseph/hendrixjoseph.github.io/blob/master/_data/blog-stats.csv) so long as there is data, however.

* Clicks &rarr; 431
* Search Impressions &rarr; 15,900
* Average position &rarr; 69.9

## AdSense

AdSense is starting to look pretty good - I think I may even reach the $100 threshold this year!

* Balance &rarr; $59.28
* Estimated earnings &rarr; $5.20
* Impressions &rarr; 2,291
* Clicks &rarr; 22

## Ratios

* Earnings / 1,000 sessions = $5.20 / 1.308 = $3.98
* Earnings / 1,000 pageviews = $5.20 / 1.602 = $3.25
* Earnings / 1,000 impressions = $5.20 / 2.291 = $2.27
* Earnings / day = $5.20 / 31 = $0.17
* Sessions / day = 1,308 / 31 = 42.2
* Pageviews / day = 1,602 / 31 = 51.7
* Impressions / day = 2,291 / 31 = 73.9
