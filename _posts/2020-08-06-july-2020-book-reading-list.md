July was a pretty good month reading-wise. It helps that my son likes to bring me books to read. However, he often usurps reading time with my daughter.

If I read something to my daughter, my son just *has* to come by and be read to, too.

## Books I Read to My Children

### Books I Read to My Son

I read twenty-seven - that 27 or two-seven - books to my son in July:

## The Book I Read for Me

I read [The Phoenix Project: A Novel about IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078Y98RG8/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20).

![The Pheonix Project](/images/books/covers/the-pheonix-project.jpg)

It's a novel about a fictional company that moves its operations from a waterfall-type environment to an agile, DevOps type environment, and becomes wildly successful in the process.

I felt things were a bit dramatized to increase the effect applying DevOps would have on a company. That, and to make a better story. Just [check out the reviews](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078Y98RG8/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20#customerReviews).

I will say I enjoyed it.

I *almost* finished a second book last month, but I didn't finish it until a few days into August. You'll just have to wait for the next book reading list to find out what book it was.
