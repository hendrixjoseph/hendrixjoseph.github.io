A new year, a new month, another blog stats report.

## AdSense

AdSense really is the only interesting metric this month. On December 19th, I received an email stating that "Ad serving limit placed on [my] AdSense account" because they "identified invalid traffic concerns in [my] AdSense account."

I don't know what caused this - as you can see by the other metrics, my impressions have increased. I did re-enable my adblocker for my site. It does look like Google stopped limiting the ads on December 29th or 30th.

* Balance &rarr; $109.28
* Estimated earnings &rarr; $57.89
* Impressions &rarr; 8,262
* Clicks &rarr; 93
