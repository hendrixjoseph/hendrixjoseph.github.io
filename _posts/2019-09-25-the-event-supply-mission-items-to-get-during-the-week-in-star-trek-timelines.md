I've been playing a mobile game called [Star Trek Timelines](https://www.joehxblog.com/star-trek-timelines/) for a year now. One aspect of the game is the weekend "event" competitions. There are different types of events - one, in particular, is supply missions.

If you've played the game (and even if you haven't) these supply missions are nearly identical to the regular supply missions. Basically, you run quick missions to get supplies. Inventory. Items.

Some of these items I have plenty. Others I need to keep getting. In fact, I've noticed that I keep getting the same few items over and over again.

So I decided to write down what these items are and where to get them so I can focus on getting these items outside of the supply missions themselves - during the week and during other types of missions.

So I present to you: the Event Supply Mission Items to Get During the Week in Star Trek Timelines!
