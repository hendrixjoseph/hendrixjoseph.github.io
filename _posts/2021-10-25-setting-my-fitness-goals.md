Sometime back in 2020, in the midst of the pandemic, I turned to my wife and asked her "what would you do if I said I wanted to start running?"

And now, almost two years later, I run four miles nearly five times a week. I've bought [a pair of running shoes](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FBCXPDP?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). I've lost over forty pounds. And my goals? Well, they keep changing.

It's more "updating" then moving goalposts. In fact - the overarching goal remains the same: *be healthy for my kids*. I want to be able to keep up with them.

But *be healthy for my kids* - while a worthy goal - is not measurable. A few goals I've set (and made) include:

* reach 20% body fat (at least according to my scale)
* remain under 225 lbs (I'm now around 208 lbs)
* Run a 5k (I've ran six this year - and even [one 10k](https://orrrc.org/tadmor-10k-results-2021/)!)
* daily run to a 5-minute walk, 40-minute run, 5-minute walk (I only did this once - but I did it!)
* continue strength training

## So what should I look to do next?

I did something that probably shouldn't be done - I searched "ideal male body measurements" online.

Keeping in mind that these numbers might not be realistist, I came across [the following numbers for a "perfect male body"](https://trustyspotter.com/blog/perfect-male-body-measurements/):

* Waist - 45% to 47% of height
* Shoulders - 1.618 times waist
* Arms - same as neck
* Chest - 10 to 12 inches greater than waist

Since I'm 6'4" - or 76 inches - that puts my "perfect" measurements at:

* Waist - 34.2 to 35.7 inches
* Shoulders - 55.3 to 57.8 inches
* Chest - 44.2 inches to 47.7 inches

Rounding the numbers and selecting an easier-to-reach point and I get:

* Waist - 36 inches
* Chest - 44 inches
* Shoulder - 55 inches
* Arm - same as neck

## Where am I Now?

Here are the measurements I took on a few days ago on October the 23rd:

* Waist - 39 inches
* Hip - 38 inches
* Chest - 39 inches
* Neck - 16 inches
* Right bicep - 13.5 inches
* Right thigh - 23 inches
* Calf - 17 inches

Obviously that's more measurements than in the goals, and it's also missing the "shoulders" measurement. But this is giving me a direction to go to.

What fitness goals do you set for yourself? Do my goals make sense? Comment below!
