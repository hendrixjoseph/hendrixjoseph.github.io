If you've been reading this blog for any amount of time, you'll know that I publish [monthly book reading lists](https://www.joehxblog.com/tags/reading-list/). While the format has changed slightly since my [first book reading list in January of 2018](https://www.joehxblog.com/january-2018-book-reading-list/), and I didn't publish one the following month, the posts have been a regular part of this blog for almost three years now.

Initially, I linked the books to Amazon using my affiliate link. But then, in February of 2019, [Amazon shut down my associate account](https://www.joehxblog.com/amazon-shut-down-my-associate-account/). Which sucked, but at the time I wasn't making a ton from Amazon.

Amazon did eventually reinstate my account but in the meantime, I changed every link to a book I could from Amazon to another site called [AbeBooks](https://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/2462910/77416/2029?u=https://www.abebooks.com/). To monetize my links to AbeBooks I used a service called [VigLink](https://www.joehxblog.com/viglink/) (which is now called Sovrn//Commerce).

VigLink involved a JavaScript plugin. I never made any money with VigLink, so at some point, I decided to disable (i.e. remove) the plugin.

I never relinked any books to Amazon. I even continue to link books to AbeBooks wherever possible.

Eventually, I decided to pursue an affiliate relationship with AbeBooks, so a few weeks ago I signed up with [their affiliate program](https://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/2462910/77416/2029?u=https://www.abebooks.com/books/AffiliateProgram/) and modified all prior AbeBooks links to be AbeBooks affiliate links.

I also updated [my privacy policy](https://www.joehxblog.com/privacy/) accordingly.

And I also have an image that I'll be throwing into the sidebar:

[![AbeBooks.com. Thousands of booksellers - millions of books.](/images/abebooks/thousands-of-booksellers-millions-of-books.png)](https://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/2462910/76887/2029)

So far, I haven't made any money with my AbeBooks affiliate. I probably won't for a while.

But I might - who knows?
