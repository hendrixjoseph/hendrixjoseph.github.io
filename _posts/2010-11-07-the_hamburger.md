Ah yes, the humble hamburger, also known as the burger. A special sandwich from the far away land of Hamburg.

...Ok enough fancy talk. As I do every Saturday evening I go to church with my Grandpa. Afterwords we always go to Bob Evans. It just so happens that Bob Evans has recently put a few more hamburgers on the menu, which they call "Farm Fresh Burgers." So I got one.

I've never been impressed with Bob Evan's other burgers. But the one I got (the "Farmstand Burger") was really good. I blame it on the 100% black Angus. I'll definitely try the others (the "Smokehouse Burger" and the "Three-Cheese Burger") in the next few weeks.

I've come not to like the fast food burgers. They always seem too dry. My friend says it's because they're using less fat in their burgers than they did before.

I really like the frozen burgers you make at home. It's really easy and really greasy. I just wonder if it's any healthier than fast food burgers.

Where did burgers come from? Well, "Hamburg" is the second largest city in Germany. My understanding was that it came from a town in the US that was named after the German city. On [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger)'s page, however, it says that no one really knows. Oh well.

Until next time
