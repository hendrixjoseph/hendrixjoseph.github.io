It started innocently enough on Monday, March 2nd. I simply received a $10 referral for referring someone to the Cash App.

Tuesday, March 3rd came and I referred two more people. Cool - that's $30 I made in two days for basically nothing.

Wednesday, March 4th I referred *eleven* people. Eleven people times ten bucks a pop is $110.

That's $150 in referrals across three days for reasons I still don't entirely know.

Things started getting crazy on Wednesday, March 5th. I can't even count how many referrals I got.

The next day, on Thursday, March 6th, I started getting a little concerned that something is going awry. I ask some people on Reddit if they have any input:

On Friday, March 6th, I'm quickly approaching 1,000 referrals. That's $10,000. Ten-thousand bucks. That's not chump change.

I tweeted on Twitter to see if anyone has anything to say:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So I have gotten over 800 referrals from a certain well-known app in the past few days - and keep getting more. At $10 a pop, that&#39;s over $8k.

On Monday, March 9th, at 11:46 am, I received an email from Square that my email had been unlinked from my Cash account. I also received a text stating that my phone number had been unlinked from my account.

*The last of my Cash Referral Emails.*

Before my email and phone number were both unlinked, I had received 1,665 referrals. At $10 a pop, that's $16,650.

Sixteen thousand six hundred and fifty dollars.

Even though the math is easy, I'm still wondering if I got the math right.

But my math is right, and Square, rightfully so, didn't want to pay out over sixteen grand - especially to someone who rarely uses their service.

So - after earning sixteen hundred referrals - Square closed my Cash account.

I was able to withdrawal - and receive in my bank account - $1050. Not quite the sixteen grand, but not nothing, either.

If you're wondering if Square was in the right to close my Cash account, they have this standard bit in their [terms of service](https://cash.app/legal/us/en-us/tos):

> 7. Termination of Account
>
>We can terminate or refuse your access to the service at any time, for any reason.
>
>Square may terminate, close, or suspend your Account or use the Service at any time for any reason. Any such termination does not relieve you of any of your obligations to Square under these Cash Terms and any amounts owed to us as provided in these Cash Terms, the General Terms, or any other agreement you have with us. We will not be responsible for any loss, damage, harm or consequences, including any delay or inconvenience you may suffer as a result of our exercise of our rights under this section.

On Tuesday, March 10th,  I did go back to Reddit to report what had happened:

<div class="reddit-embed" data-embed-media="www.redditmedia.com" data-embed-parent="false" data-embed-live="true" data-embed-uuid="ebd860e3-e016-4fed-93b0-6bad56c4c8e0" data-embed-created="2020-03-13T18:43:10.758Z"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/fgafz7/daily_fi_discussion_thread_march_10_2020/fk3zrzt/">Comment</a> from discussion <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/fgafz7/daily_fi_discussion_thread_march_10_2020/">Daily FI discussion thread - March 10, 2020</a>.</div><script async src="https://www.redditstatic.com/comment-embed.js"></script>

Oh - remember how I received an email stating that my email was unlinked? In that email, it said, "If you did not request this change, please let us know."

So I did "let them know" via their [contact support page](https://cash.app/support#contact-support/ACCESS_MY_ACCOUNT):

> At 11:46 am today (March 9, 2020) I received an email stating that my email (hendrixjoseph@aol.com) had been unlinked from my account.
>
> I also received a text message at with the same timestamp stating that my phone number (***-***-****) had been unlinked from my account.
>
> I neither requested nor initiated unlinking either my email or phone number from my account.
> 
> I also noticed that my "cashtag" $joehx (https://cash.app/$joehx) no longer exists - or at least the webpage returns a 404.
>
> I would like to confirm that this is the case - my main concern is that my account has been hacked into.

But I received nothing but a canned response on how to recover an old account. I've heard nothing since then.

## Where Did These Referrals Come From?

I still have no idea.

I do have my referral posted on two referral threads:

* [Doctor of Credit post from June 16, 2017](https://www.doctorofcredit.com/square-cash-app-offering-10-sign-bonus-10-referral-bonus-free/#comment-375583)
* [/r/churning Official Square Cash Referral Thread from December 2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/7k0zes/official_square_cash_referral_thread/drasmmh/)

Of course, I also have my referral - although it's via a redirect on this site - on a pinned post on my [Reddit user page](https://www.reddit.com/user/joehx/) and on the [referral section of this site](https://www.joehxblog.com/referral/).

Plus I did a [Square Cash Review](https://www.joehxblog.com/square-cash-review/) a while back - back before it got renamed to just Cash.
