It's the last day of the year. And, has been since tradition since 2016, I'm posting my end-of-year income report.

Here are the other six:

* [2021 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2021-end-of-year-side-income-report/)
* [2020 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2020-end-of-year-side-income-report/)
* [2019 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2019-end-of-year-side-income-report/)
* [2018 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2018-end-of-year-side-income-report/)
* [2017 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2017-end-of-year-side-income-report/)
* [2016 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2016-end-of-year-side-income-report/)

## Credit Card Rewards

* [Chase Freedom Unlimited](https://www.joehxblog.com/chase-freedom-unlimited/) &rarr; $190.34
* [Chase Freedom Flex](https://www.joehxblog.com/chase-freedom/) &rarr; $72.45
* Chase Freedom &rarr; $358.07
* US Bank Cash+ &rarr; $130.75
* [Capital One Quicksilver](https://www.joehxblog.com/capital-one-quicksilver/) &rarr; $25.86
* Citi Double Cash &rarr; $864.79
* Total &rarr; $1642.26

No new cards this year, so my Citi Double Cash made the most this year.

## Interest-Bearing Accounts

* [Arrived Homes](https://arrivedhomes.com/) &rarr; $3.90
* Treasury Direct &rarr; $1.26
* [Robinhood Dividends](https://www.joehxblog.com/robinhood/) &rarr; $133.75 
* Robinhood Option Premiums &rarr; $105.00
* Robinhood Interest &rarr; $0.50
* Robinhood Stock Lending &rarr; $2.94
* [WeBull](https://www.joehxblog.com/webull/) &rarr; $2.68
* [Worthy Bonds](https://www.joehxblog.com/worthybonds/) &rarr; $3.19
* Credit Union Interest &rarr; $121.43 + 2.48 + 2.48
* Ally Interest &rarr; $484.47
* Total &rarr; $864.08

*Interest-Bearing* means anything that I may receive a 1099-INT or 1099-DIV for. In other words - bank account interest and dividends.

My local credit union has been paying [6% interest](https://www.joehxblog.com/wright-patt-credit-union-quietly-doubles-truesaver-rate/) on amounts up to $500 for several years now. Since my wife and I both have accounts, we're getting that 6% interest on $1,000 - meaning we earn at least sixty dollars together. Coupled with other incentives, that pushed us to the eighty-six we did earn.

The Ally high-interest account has claimed back up to 3.3% - nice, but not so nice when paired with the inflation we've been having.

[Worthy Bonds](https://www.joehxblog.com/worthybonds/) does pay a decent 5%, but they're "junk bonds" (although they are secured) and there's not an unlimited supply of them. They did send out [a concerning email](https://www.joehxblog.com/is-worthy-bonds-having-liquidity-problems/) a few months ago

## Print-On-Demand Sites

* [Merch by Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=%22joehx%22&i=fashion&tag=hendrixjoseph-20) &rarr; $908.80
* [Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com/people/joehx) &rarr; $102.73
* [TeePublic](https://www.joehxblog.com/teepublic/) &rarr; $78.75
* [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/joehx/) &rarr; $10.01
* Total &rarr; $1,100.29

[Merch by Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=%22joehx%22&i=fashion&tag=hendrixjoseph-20) is my money maker here earning almost a grand. Combined with my [Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com/people/joehx) and [TeePublic](https://www.joehxblog.com/teepublic/) I've made over a grand.

A also got ten bucks from [the Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/joehx/) for my crappy icons.

## Blogging

* Amazon Associates &rarr; $468.63
* Paid Guest Post &rarr; $97.01
* Paid Back Link &rarr; $19.40
* Google AdSense &rarr; $781.76
* Total &rarr; $1,366.80

My blog is finally making some money.

My Amazon Associates account is still making decent money thanks to this [Dorco post](https://www.joehxblog.com/how-to-get-dorco-razor-blades-after-dorcousa-shuts-down/) I made over two years ago.

Google AdSense makes about $50 a month - and with the payout threshold at $100, I get paid about every other month.

## Cryptocurrency Earnings

* BlockFi &rarr; $68.54
* [Coinbase](https://www.joehxblog.com/coinbase/) &rarr; $88.05
* Total &rarr; $154.59

Should I even include BlockFi in this report with their bankruptcy and the collapse of FTX? Even if I never see it, I "earned" $68.54. Depending on how the bankruptcy proceedings go, I might be able to write some off on my 2023 taxes. Until then, I'll claim that small biut.

[Coinbase](https://www.joehxblog.com/coinbase/) is split between staking and earning. Although, with the staking, it certainly is a case of "not your keys, not your coins." Coinbase is publicly traded, so I hope there's more scrutiny there.

* Coinbase Earn &rarr; $69.64
* Coinbase Interest &rarr; $18.41

## Miscellaneous

* Vitality &rarr; $225.00
* Equifax Breach Settlement &rarr; $5.21
* Plaid Settlement &rarr; $35.97
* Greater Goods Survey &rarr; $27.82
* Clinical Study &rarr; $2,210.00
* [Receipt Hog](https://www.joehxblog.com/receipt-hog/) &rarr; $80.00
* [Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/) &rarr; $35.17
* Total &rarr; $2,619.17

The "Greater Goods Survey" was reimbursement for purchasing an [AccuCheck Digital Body Weight Scale](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08VS58Y7W?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) and responding to a survey. It *did not* require leaving a review on Amazon.

[Vitality](https://www.powerofvitality.com/) is reimbursement for gym membership fees from my wife's health care plan.
