Another month over, and another month begins. We're halfway through 2020.

Here's my reading status for June.

## Books I Read to My Children

### Books I Read to My Son

I read thirteen books to my son. Coincidentally, he can count to thirteen now, too.

### Books I Read to My Daughter

I read six books to my daughter:

* [Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?](https://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/2462910/77416/2029?u=https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9780805002010/30669713207)

## The Book I Read for Me

The book I read for me was the second volume of a book I read almost two years ago in [October 2018](https://www.joehxblog.com/october-2018-book-reading-list/).

That book was [Star Trek: The Eugenics Wars: The Rise and Fall of Khan Noonien Singh: Volume One](https://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/2462910/77416/2029?u=https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9780743406420/30193774623), so naturally, the second one is called [Star Trek: The Eugenics Wars: The Rise and Fall of Khan Noonien Singh: Volume Two](https://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/2462910/77416/2029?u=https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9780743406444).

It was good to get back to physical books these past two months. This month's book was enjoyable, as well. There were quite a few "Easter Egg" characters in the book (although some were main characters). Basically, almost every character that existed on Earth during the 20th Century in Star Trek was in the book.

These characters included:

* [Clare Raymond](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Clare_Raymond)
* [Gary Seven](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Gary_Seven)
* [Guinan](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Guinan)
* [Jeff Carlson](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Jeff_Carlson)
* [Nichols](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Nichols)
* [Rain Robinson](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Rain_Robinson)
* [Ralph Offenhouse](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Ralph_Offenhouse)
* [Roberta Lincoln](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Roberta_Lincoln)
* [Shannon O'Donnel](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Shannon_O%27Donnel)

That's it for this month. I am back to reading books on my [Kindle](https://amzn.to/2Z4ryKq), so stay tuned next month to find out what I'm reading!
