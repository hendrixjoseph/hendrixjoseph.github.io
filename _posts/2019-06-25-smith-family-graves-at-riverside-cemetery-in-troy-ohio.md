About a week ago I headed to [Riverside Cemetery in Troy, Ohio]( https://www.troyohio.gov/225/Riverside-Cemetery) with my wife and son. I wanted to look at (and take pictures of!) some graves of my ancestors.

The particular graves I was looking for were the graves of my great-grandfather H. Robert Smith and Thelma Smith, his wife (but not my biological great-grandfather).

The reason I wanted to visit the graves for these two people was two-fold: I knew them when they were still alive, and I had visited the graves many years ago when I was still a teenager.

There was just one issue last week when we visited: I didn't know exactly where the graves where! With over 16,000 memorials, at least according to [the Riverside Cemetery on Find A Grave](https://www.findagrave.com/cemetery/42935/riverside-cemetery), finding the exact sites seemed impossible.

From what I remember when I visited as a teen (keep in mind I'm 35 now, so this is at least 15 years ago) is that the site was next to a road - perhaps one of the internal roads?

So we drove around the cemetery looking at the graves. Curiously, even though Smith is supposed to be a common name, we didn't see any tombstones with Smith on them.

So, we were making one last pass through the cemetery when I noticed this huge marker:

In case someone else wants to find these plots, here's there approximate location on a map of Riverside Cemetery:

I found the following gravesites around the larger Smith Headstone:

* Howard Robert Smith, my great-grandfather
* Thelma M Smith, my step-great-grandmother
* Benjamin Franklin Smith, my great-great-great-grandfather
* Alice C Smith, my great-great-great-grandmother
* Murray Smith, my great-great-great-uncle
* Cory E Smith, my great-great-great-uncle
* Anne R Smith, the wife of Cory E Smith

Not to disappoint, I did take pictures of each headstone. I uploaded the photos to Find A Grave (you can see them on [the photo section of my user profile](https://www.findagrave.com/user/49849072/photos/m)), but I'll also display them here:

*Thelma M (1915 - ) and H Robert Smith (1909 - 1992)*

> Thelma died in 2008. I asked my mom if she was buried here. My mom wasn't sure since Thelma was cremated, but she said she thought the ashes were buried here.

*B F Smith 1855 - 1931*

> "B F" stands for Benjamin Franklin. There are actually a few people named "Benjamin Franklin Smith" in my family tree, all in close relation.

*Anne R Smith 1892 - 1961*

If you're wondering how exactly all these people are related to me, here's a little diagram I made:

![How everyone buried here is related to me.](/images/cemetery/ohio/troy/riverside/smith/smith-plot-diagram.png)
*How everyone buried here is related to me.*

There are other people in this cemetery that I am related to - namely the [Genslingers](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/67392472/george-genslinger) and additional [Smiths](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/70939295/orrin-blaine-smith).

I'll have to head back sometime to see if I can figure out where their graves are located.
