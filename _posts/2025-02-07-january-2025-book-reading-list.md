January was a slow month for me, reading-wise.

I read only three different books to my son and six different books to my daughter.

Granted, my son can now read to himself, but he still enjoys being read to.

I also only finished one book for myself.

## The Book I Read for Me

I read [Starter Villain](https://www.amazon.com/Starter-Villain-John-Scalzi/dp/1250879396/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) by John Scalzi, which was recommended by New Scientist magazine awhile back. Apparently Mr. Scalzi is a prominent modem sci-fi author? His [Amazon book page](https://www.amazon.com/stores/author/B001IGJOCA/allbooks?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) has 190 titles, many of which are works translated into other languages.
