Another month gone. We're already about halfway through the year. Amazing. It's time to write about the books I read last month in May.

## The Books I Read for Me

Last month I read the first two books in the *Harry Potter* series: [Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone](https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Sorcerers-Stone-Rowling-ebook/dp/B0192CTMYG/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) and [Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets](https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Chamber-Secrets-Rowling-ebook/dp/B0192CTMW8/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). Despite being a kid in the 90s (I was born in 1984) I never read them back in the day. I *do* remember my mom reading them (out loud!) to my little brother - he was born in 1992.

I bit of research shows the first book was originally published in 1998 (in the US). That would have made him five for most of the year. I'm not sure when my mom started reading them to him when he was five, but I wouldn't be surprised.

I have seen the movies, so I know some of the plot. But I've forgotten enough that I can enjoy what's happening.

> I borrowed these two books through Amazon's [Prime Reading](https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/hz/bookshelf/prime/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) program. If you don’t have Amazon Prime, you can [try Amazon Prime with a 30-Day free trial](https://www.amazon.com/tryprimefree?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). There’s also [Prime Discounted Monthly Offering](https://www.amazon.com/l/16256994011?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) if you qualify, as well as a [Prime Student 6-month Trial](https://www.amazon.com/gp/student/signup/info/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) if you have a dot-edu email address.

If you've been reading these book-reading lists for the past several months, you'll know I've adopted an alternating fiction-non-fiction reading pattern. I kept up with this policy last month, meaning I didn't read those two *Harry Potter* books back-to-back.

In between, I read [The Renaissance: A History from Beginning to End](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01GCYLWBI/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) from [Hourly History](https://www.amazon.com/Hourly-History/e/B01HXXGBSQ?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). I wrote about Hourly History [last month](https://www.joehxblog.com/april-2021-book-reading-list/): Hourly History publishes a bunch of quick reads meant to be read in one hour. They also give away their books often. You can either look at their Amazon page or check out their [blog](https://www.hourlyhistory.com/blog/) to see what books they have that are free.

What have you read in the past month? Be sure to let me know in the comments below!
