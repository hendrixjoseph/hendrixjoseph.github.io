I finished 2018 strong, having read 15 different books for myself - three times as many as [I read in 2017]({{ site.url }}/the-5-books-i-read-in-2017/). I only read one book in December, but I was determined to finish it by the end of the month/year so I could say I read 3x as many books in 2018 as I read in 2017.

Which I can, and did, say!

## The Book I Read for Me

The book I read for me is **[The ONE Thing: The Surprisingly Simple Truth Behind Extraordinary Results](https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9781885167774/30240279074)**.

The title of the book seems to imply that it's going to bestow some knowledge about the most important thing - something that everyone should focus one. Something more akin to the book **[The Secret](https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9781582701707/30227671745)**.

But it doesn't. It never really defines exactly what the "one thing" is. That's because everyone's "one thing" is different - and may even be different at different times.

Instead, the premise of the book is that you should focus on one thing at a time. It is anti-multitasking - it even discusses the cons of multitasking in one chapter.

One thing (hah! see what I did there) I liked is not the book itself, but rather how I came across it. I've had Amazon Prime for a number of years (in fact, Amazon Prime Student thanks to my .edu email) and mainly enjoyed for the "free" shipping, and a few shows such as [Mr. Robot](https://www.amazon.com/eps1-0_hellofriend-mov/dp/B00YBX664Q/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) and [The Man in the High Castle](https://www.amazon.com/The-New-World/dp/B00RSI4WY2/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20).

Apparently, another benefit of Amazon Prime is [Prime Reading](https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/hz/bookshelf/prime/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). If I understand it correctly, you can read a bunch of books for free. It's not as great as [Kindle Unlimited](https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/hz/signup/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) - the choices are slimmer. Also, you "borrow" the books and can only borrow ten at a time.

If you don't have Amazon Prime, you can [try Amazon Prime with a 30-Day free trial](https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). Let me know in the comments at the bottom of this post if you can get the Prime Reading to work, if you like it, and if I got any of the facts wrong about it.

Oh, and if you [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/{{ site.footer-links.twitter }}) or [like my Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/{{ site.footer-links.facebook }}), you'll notice that's I've been [tweeting](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=from%3A%40{{ site.footer-links.twitter }}%20The%20ONE%20Thing&src=typd) or [posting](https://www.facebook.com/{{ site.footer-links.facebook }}/posts/1986438728100842?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARC3_TI5q3X2QveATdlThf6cVHZjCsuO_d5ZZ3TPeJ8uqSXh8GTtI-qfhhf4g0cGknzoKTbt_bbHQABhjKJpKwZK4tbabJfmAev-Y5kRNVgxy9wpyZ-jdmcUMnivMldv5NTwe8twuLPFtDUd6F48sNGFhfA2dfObo1E6Q4udtjwFz4dI8VjJVSC_iKz6FLxu-rw1BKKK1RtE_FTuiWsW3-8-p_g-KlsK9s6iYgP6ShvJgWof3B94mCsE-YNHQBpuUKcxz_MVjnHbSkcBt2ngDu5BsFg9EBy9EFu7GbkrM0CxwI55ng9IHLIH6OxngKYTGXOkLAERjuytFe8Gg2-FFhnJqYm2&__tn__=-R) snippets from the books I've been reading.

Here are some tweets with quotes from The ONE Thing:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-cards="hidden" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When you say yes to something, it’s imperative that you understand what you’re saying no to.

## Books I Read to My Son

Reading to my son is essential. Not only is it good in the general sense that it's good to read to children, but I tend to be quiet and not talk. Reading to him forces me to vocalize and talk to him. The bonding is great, too.

However, it's become increasingly difficult to read to him. Not because I don't have time, or because I can't speak or see, but because he's become so mobile. He wants to explore, not sit on my lap while I read a book. So when I sit him on my lap, he more than likely will wiggle and climb off my lap and onto the floor.

He doesn't walk yet, but he can crawl rather quickly. I can't imagine the trouble he'll get into once he learns to walk!

I was able to read to him five different books (but more than five different times!). The trick seems to be to read to him when he's getting tired and *wants* to stay on my lap.

Here are the five books I read to my son in December:

* [Polar Bear, Polar Bear, What Do You Hear?](https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9780805053883/30130515213)
* [I Love My Daddy Because...](https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9780525472506/22447691600)
* [Daddy Hugs](https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9780689877711/22718106864)
* [Giraffes Can't Dance](https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9780439539470/30087127131)
* [Newtonian Physics for Babies](https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9781492656203/30223004124)

How's your month of December go? Did you read any good books? Do you intend on checking out that Prime Reading thing?
