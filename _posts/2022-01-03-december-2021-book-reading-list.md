December is the last month of the year. The month of Advent and Christmas. Of the winter solstice and snow.

It didn't snow much, but I did read much. In fact, I read 17 different books to my son and 16 different books to my daughter, and 2 for me.

## The Books I Read for Me

Here's the two I read:

* [Own Your Tech Career](https://www.amazon.com/Own-Your-Tech-Career-technologists/dp/1617299073/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) by [Don Jones](https://www.amazon.com/Don-Jones/e/B001ILKEJW/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20)
* [Discipline That Lasts a Lifetime](https://www.amazon.com/Discipline-That-Lasts-Lifetime-Best-ebook/dp/B005DFBXA8/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) by [Dr. Ray Guarendi](https://www.amazon.com/Raymond-Guarendi/e/B001JS4EOA/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20)

The first I read at work. I actually found it to be rather decent.

The second I read as a physical copy. It was okay. In fact, that seems to be the general gist of the reviews, too.

Onto January!
