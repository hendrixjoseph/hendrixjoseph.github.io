The first half of 2019 is almost a month over. This makes it a good time to give a sales report on my t-shirt / print-on-demand side hustle.

Perhaps a bit overdue, since we're nearly a month into the second half.

If you want to check out my other t-shirt sales reports, here are some links:

* [Second Half 2018 Merch by Amazon Sales Report](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/second-half-2018-merch-by-amazon-sales-report/)

First, some details.

This report spans the time from January 1, 2019, through June 30, 2019. It details what products I've sold, and what the royalties are on them. It's not necessarily what I've been paid (i.e. what's been deposited into my bank account) since there is often a delay from when a product is sold to when I get paid.

## Teespring

Nothing. Nada. Zip.

Seriously. I haven't had any luck with [Teespring](https://teespring.com/stores/joehxs-store). I have, in the entire time I've had t-shirts on TeeSpring, sold a few. But that's it.

Since I don't do well with Teespring, I also put no effort into it anymore.

## Redbubble

I've made a whopping $15.88 on [Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com/people/joehx?asc=u) in the first half of the year. Which is much better than the zero I've made on Teespring.

I also don't get paid as often with Redbubble as I used to since the reinstated their [$20 threshold policy](https://help.redbubble.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027407652).

Month-by-month, here's what I've made on Redbubble:

Month | Royalty
--- | ---:
January | $5.50
February | $4.03
March | $0.08
April |  $0.00
May | $3.09
June | $3.18

## TeePublic

I've made $47 on [TeePublic](https://www.teepublic.com/user/joehx) the first half of this year. Which is more than pocket change, but not enough to live on.

## Merch by Amazon

Time for the big guns - Merch by Amazon. Selling [t-shirts](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/t-shirts/) (and [PopSockets](https://hendrixjoseph.github.io/popsockets/)!) on Amazon is my money-maker. I've made a total of $783.76 in the first six months of 2019.

This certainly dwarfs any of the other print-on-demand platforms - even combined!

One frustrating thing with Merch by Amazon is that you get negative royalties if an item is returned. That said, of the 327 units sold during the first half of 2019, 7 were canceled, and 11 were returned.

That's a cancel and return rate of about 5%.

Still totally worth it.
