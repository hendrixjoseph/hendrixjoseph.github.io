Another day, another dollar. Or, in this case, another month, another blog stats report. This is the fourth monthly blog statistics report. If you're interested in checking out the first three, here are some links:

* [January 2018 Blog Statistics](https://www.joehxblog.com/january-2018-blog-statistics/)
* [February 2018 Blog Statistics](https://www.joehxblog.com/february-2018-blog-statistics/)
* [March 2018 Blog Statistics](https://www.joehxblog.com/march-2018-blog-statistics/)

Life has been good recently. Busy and good. And despite being busy with life, school, and work, I was able to publish three blog posts:

* [Let's Complicate Things]({{ site.url }}/lets-complicate-things/)
* [March 2018 Book Reading List]({{ site.url }}/march-2018-book-reading-list/)
* [Life Update]({{ site.url }}/life-update/)

Honestly, I thought I'd done less than last month, but apparently, I did three posts last month as well. I did okay stats-wise, but my Google Analytics and AdSense numbers are slightly less - a combination of not having time to promote, and I had that nice [Rockstar Finance Feature]({{ site.url }}/when-is-energy-efficiency-worth-the-investment/) last time.

My Alexa number is under a million now! That means there are less than a million sites that are visited more often than mine. Well, at least by Alexa's estimate.

Without further ado, here are the numbers:

## Alexa

* Global Rank &rarr; 973,148
* Rank in the United States &rarr; 284,490
* Total Sites Linking In &rarr; 144

## Google Analytics

* Sessions &rarr; 1,579
* Users &rarr; 1,247
* Pageviews &rarr; 1,947

*Google Analytics Graph for April*

## AdSense

* Estimated earnings &rarr; $2.16
* Impressions &rarr; 1,364
* Clicks &rarr; 2

## Ratios

* Earnings / 1,000 sessions = $2.16 / 1.579 = $1.37
* Earnings / 1,000 pageviews = $2.16 / 1.947 = $1.11
* Earnings / 1,000 impressions = $2.16 / 1.364 = $1.58
* Earnings / day = $2.16 / 31 = $0.07
* Sessions / day = 1,579 / 31 = 50.9
* Pageviews / day = 1,947 / 31= 62.8
* Impressions / day = 1,364 / 31 = 44.0
