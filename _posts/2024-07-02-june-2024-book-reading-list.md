June 2024 is over. Time for another book reading list.

I read ten books to my son and twenty books to my daughter.

And I only managed to read (& finish) one book for myself.

## The Books I Read for Me

Continuing on reading Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, I read [Forward the Foundation](https://www.amazon.com/Forward-Foundation-Isaac-Asimov/dp/0553565079/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20).

It was the only book I managed to read in June. But, hey, that's my goal: at least one book a month.
