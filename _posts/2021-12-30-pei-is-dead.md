Pei is dead. As in the cash back app that allowed you to earn Bitcoin. *Not* Prince Edward Island.

Here's a screenshot of an email I received 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Goodbye, <a href="https://twitter.com/get_pei?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@get_pei</a>, it was nice knowing you.<br><br>(also, CC <a href="https://twitter.com/Drofcredit?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Drofcredit</a> - I thought you might want to let your readers know. Pei seems to have died; see the reviews on the Google Play store) <a href="https://t.co/IMHREejHVO">pic.twitter.com/IMHREejHVO</a></p>&mdash; Joseph Hendrix (@JoeHxBlog) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeHxBlog/status/1474192400457383941?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 24, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

> ## Pei will be winding down Bitcoin Wallet functionality on December 31, 2021.

> Here's what this means for you:
>
> If you are currently holding a bitcoin balance on Pei, you will have until December 26, 2021 to sell or withdraw your Bitcoin holdings from the platform.

> After December 26, if you still are holding a balance, we will attempt to sell your balance and return it to a bank account on file.

If you check out the [reviews on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.youpei.android) you'll see the app hasn't been working for a few months now. Heck, it even [hasn't been working on the Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pei-automatic-cash-back/id1365267078).

Some people have been successful loading it on an older version of Android; I did get it to load through the emulator provided with Android Studio, but I couldn't withdraw.

I did deposit $21 bucks into their interest account. We'll see if I end up getting anything back.

Remember, folks: not your keys, not your coins - and never ~~invest~~ speculate more than you're willing to lose!
