title: ChatGPT Slow Cooker Chicken Curry
tags: [chatgpt, cooking]

Back in September I asked ChatGPT how to make chicken curry in our [slow-cooker](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=slow+cooker&tag=hendrixjoseph-20) (aka [Crock Pot](https://www.amazon.com/stores/Crock-PotBrand/page/C09563BD-7BCB-4A7C-AA82-4C310E7E20D7?tag=hendrixjoseph-20)).

I didn't use the first recipe it gave me - I had it refine the recipe until I was happy with the results. I made it, and, while my kids didn't like it (they're 4 and 6 and don't like trying new foods) my wife enjoyed it.

I'm making it again today, so I figured I'd copy the recipe here on my blog so I can reference it without searching for it on ChatGPT.

Here's the recipe:

## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 pounds (about 700g) boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces
* 1 large onion, finely chopped
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, minced
* 2 tablespoons curry powder
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
* 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
* 1/2 teaspoon paprika (for color; optional)
* 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for heat)
* 1 can (14 oz/400 ml) diced tomatoes
* 1 can (14 oz/400 ml) coconut milk
* 1/2 cup chicken broth
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste
* 1 tablespoon olive oil or melted butter (optional, for richness)
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 1/2 cup frozen peas (optional)
* Fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)
* Cooked rice or naan bread (for serving)

## Instructions

1. Prepare the Ingredients:

   Chop the onions, garlic, and ginger. Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces.

2. Combine Ingredients in the Slow Cooker:

   Place the chopped onions, garlic, and ginger into the bottom of the slow cooker.

   Add the chicken pieces on top of the aromatics.

3. Add Spices and Liquids:

   Sprinkle the curry powder, cumin, turmeric, coriander, paprika, and cayenne pepper (if using) over the chicken.

   Add the diced tomatoes, coconut milk, chicken broth, and tomato paste.

   Drizzle the olive oil or melted butter over the top for added richness (optional).

   Season with salt and pepper.

4. Mix Ingredients Together:

   Stir gently to combine all the ingredients. Ensure the chicken is coated with the spices and liquids.

5. Cook the Curry:

   Cover the slow cooker with its lid and set it to cook on low for 6-8 hours or high for 3-4 hours. The chicken should be tender and fully cooked through, and the flavors well developed.

6. Add Peas (if using):

   About 30 minutes before the end of the cooking time, add the frozen peas to the slow cooker. Stir them in and continue cooking.

7. Finish and Serve:

   Taste the curry and adjust the seasoning with more salt and pepper if needed.

   Serve the chicken curry hot, garnished with fresh cilantro, over cooked rice or with naan bread on the side.
