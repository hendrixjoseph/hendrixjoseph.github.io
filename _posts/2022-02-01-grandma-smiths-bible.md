I have a few primary source documents regarding my genealogy laying around. One of those items is an old family bible - a bible in a box labeled *Grandmother Smith's Bible*.

*Which* grandmother Smith is it?

Fortunately, two pages have been carefully removed and are in good shape. These pages are in good shape, and are written with a blue marker by my late great-grandfather *H. Robert Smith*. He denoted that the bible belonged to Alice C. Smith.

It turns out that Alice C. Smith was *his* grandmother - making her my great-great-great-grandmother. More specifically, she's my mother's mother's father's father's mother. Or - the other way around - the mother of the father of the father of the mother of my mother.

In biblical terms (and to put names to everyone) Alice C. Smith begot Orrin Blaine Smith. Orrin Blaine Smith begot H. Robert Smith. H. Robert Smith begot Nancy Hunter. Nancy Hunter begot my mother. My mother begot me.

Below, I have scans of the two pages. Each page image is a link to a larger resolution image. I've attempted to transcribe the image to the best of my ability - but I may have gotten things wrong.
