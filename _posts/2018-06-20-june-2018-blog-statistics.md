The year is already half over, meaning this is the sixth blog statistics report with six more to go this year. I'm looking forward to December's end-of-year report when I can graph these values, although I suppose six values are enough to graph.

A few meta status comments regarding this blog:

I revamped the [tags section](https://www.joehxblog.com/tags/): instead of having a separate page for each tag, I have one page with a list of tags, and a list of what posts are under that tag

I also added a [referral link page]({{ site.url }}/referral/) just for the fun of it - all referral links on that page are just redirects to the actual link

Finally, although I haven't done it yet, I'll be removing the StumbleUpon share/stumble social media button. StumbleUpon is closing down at the end of the month. It's being effectively replaced by [Mix](https://mix.com). I do have a [Mix profile](https://mix.com/joehx) and might add a Mix share button to replace the StumbleUpon button.

I was able to publish four blog posts in the past month:

* [4th of July Independence Day Themed Table Topics]({{ site.url }}/4th-of-july-independence-day-themed-table-topics/)
* [Will Making Twice-Monthly Half Mortgage Payments Save Money?]({{ site.url }}/will-making-twice-monthly-half-mortgage-payments-save-money/)
* [2004 Honda Civic Cabin Air Filter Replacement]({{ site.url }}/2004-honda-civic-cabin-air-filter-replacement/)
* [May 2018 Book Reading List]({{ site.url }}/may-2018-book-reading-list/)

Onto the numbers:

## Alexa

* Global Rank &rarr; 1,132,272
* Rank in the United States &rarr; 181,152
* Total Sites Linking In &rarr; 148

## Google Analytics

* Sessions &rarr; 1,251
* Users &rarr; 1,081
* Pageviews &rarr; 1,636

*Google Analytics Graph for June*

## AdSense

* Estimated earnings &rarr; $1.26
* Impressions &rarr; 863
* Clicks &rarr; 1

## Ratios

* Earnings / 1,000 sessions = $1.26 / 1.251 = $1.01
* Earnings / 1,000 pageviews = $1.26 / 1.636 = $0.77
* Earnings / 1,000 impressions = $1.26 / 0.863 = $1.46
* Earnings / day = $1.26 / 31 = $0.04
* Sessions / day = 1,251 / 31 = 40.4
* Pageviews / day = 1,636 / 31= 52.8
* Impressions / day = 863 / 31 = 27.8

I've done better with earnings - which is probably the most important number! But my Alexa has slipped back over 1 million since April when it was under a million.

I think I'm doing fine - probably better than if I didn't do these blog reports and keep track.
