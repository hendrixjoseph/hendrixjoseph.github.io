What an interesting month January was reading-wise. For the first time in her 24 months of existence, I read *more* books to my daughter than to my son.

In fact I read 38 different books to my daughter - compared to only 17 books to my son.

I also finished one book for me.

## The Book I Read for Me

In January I finished [The Fellowship of the Ring](https://www.amazon.com/Fellowship-Ring-J-R-Tolkien/dp/9993175315/?tag=hendrixjoseph).

I've never read the Lord of the Rings series - although I have read The Hobbit. I felt that, after finishing Harry Potty for the first time in the past few months, I needed to read more "classic" fantasy that I've never read.

The edition I'm reading my wife bought in Brazil many years ago when she was there for a college trip. It is in English (I don't speak - or read - Portuguese) - but in British English, not American English. In other words, *color* is spelled *colour*. Not a big deal.

I'll be finishing the next two books in the series - which are all considered one novel - over the next few months. Interjected with a bit on nonfiction between each, of course.
