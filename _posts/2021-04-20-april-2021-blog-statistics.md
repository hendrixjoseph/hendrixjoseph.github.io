It's the twentieth. I may not have been making as many of my non-regular posts, but I'm going to be consistent with my regular posts. Including this month's blog status report.

The reason I've not been making as many "non-regular" posts is that 
I've been focusing more on [my campaign site](https://joe4huberheights.com).

In fact, I've made 14 posts on my campaign site over the past two months compared to only two posts on this site in the past month.

The 14 posts on my campaign site:

## Alexa

My Alexa rank continues to slip - it's nearing two million now:

* Global Rank &rarr; 1,734,555

## Google Analytics

Nothing special from my Google Analytics except consistant views:

* Sessions &rarr; 4628
* Users &rarr; 4167
* Pageviews &rarr; 5654

## Google Search Console

Same thing for my Search Console - consistant clicks & impressions:

* Clicks &rarr; 2,830
* Search Impressions &rarr; 76,500
* Average position &rarr; 26.2

## AdSense

AdSense has been weird these past few months. Three times my ad serving has been limited.

The first time was for eleven days from December 19th through December 30th.

The second time was for fifteen days from January 22nd through February 6th.

The third time was for fourteen days from March 4th through March 18th.

Here's a graph reflecting my earnings and impressions zeroing out each time:

{% include image.html src="/images/blog-stats/2021/04/adsense-limited-three-times.png" caption="A graph reflecting my earnings and impressions zeroing out three times." %}

The only common element I've been able to determine between each time is that my earnings reached the payout threshold - $100. We'll see if that happens the next time I reach the payout threshold.

In the meantime, here's my AdSense stats for this month:

* Balance &rarr; $55.77
* Estimated earnings &rarr; $74.75
* Impressions &rarr; 14,109
* Clicks &rarr; 131

## Moz Stats

Both my Moz domain authority and the number of linking domains are up one:

Moz Domain Authority &rarr; 32
Moz Linking Domains &rarr; 500

## Ratios

* Earnings / 1,000 sessions = $74.75 / 4.628 = $16.15
* Earnings / 1,000 pageviews = $74.75 / 5.654 = $13.22
* Earnings / 1,000 impressions = $74.75 / 14.109 = $5.30
* Earnings / day = $74.75 / 31 = $2.41
* Sessions / day = 4,628 / 31 = 149.3
* Pageviews / day = 5,654 / 31 = 182.4
* Impressions / day = 14,109 / 31 = 455.1
