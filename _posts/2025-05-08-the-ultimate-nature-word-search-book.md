Last July I published [two word search puzzle books](). I even ran a little contest.

This month I released another word search book:

[![The Ultimate Nature Word Search Book](/images/books/covers/the-ultimate-nature-word-search-book.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Nature-Word-Search-Book/dp/B0F7G9CX7M?tag=hendrixjoseph-20)
*[The Ultimate Nature Word Search Book](https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Nature-Word-Search-Book/dp/B0F7G9CX7M?tag=hendrixjoseph-20)*

This book features 80 nature-themed word search puzzles.

I don't plan on doing a giveaway for this book, but who knows, I might eventually change my mind. Right now I'm trying to think of other niche topics I can write a word search book about. Maybe each US State?

Any suggestions?
