The stats for this blog continue to be steady, neither really improving but not getting worse either. No spikes in traffic any day, either.

This edition of blog statistics marks my 10th post. You can view the previous nine via the links below. Nine links seem to be a bit much, so going forward I'm going to have to think of another way to present the ever-growing list.
