By the time February was half-over, I realized I hadn't read *any* books to my kids.

Zero books to my son. Zero books to my daughter.

Part of this was because my son is reading more and more by himself - after all, my wife has him read to himself for 15 minutes every night.

I can't come up with a good excuse for not reading to my daughter for the first half of the month, though.

And I know there will come a time when neither of them want me to read to them. So I made sure I did read to them sometime during the rest of February.

I ended up reading six different books to my son and 10 different books to my daughter.

And I read two different books for myself.

## The Books I Read for Me+

The fiction book I read was [Exit to Eden](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DB3FU2G/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). A bit out of my comfort zone.

For non-fiction, I read [Man Overboard!: A Medical Lifeline for the Aging Male](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09ZBLS81P/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). I just passed four decades, so I thought this book would be relevant to me. It did seem to a aimed at a bit older age than me (maybe someone in their 50s or older) but not totally irrelevant. The tone attempted to be comedic, which did make it a bit easier to read. I would say the tone was similar to some of the [*for Dummies*](https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/40182AD8-851B-4944-8786-0D064157A931?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) series of books.
