title: Another Decent Chat with ChatGPT - Setting a Content Length in Spring Boot
tags: [chatgpt, programming]
---

At work, after a Spring Boot upgrade, we suddenly started getting [411 Length Required](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/411) error when making HTTP requests.

For whatever reason, we now needed to manually set the content length header in our [HttpHeaders](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/http/HttpHeaders.html).

Knowing that, I refined my approach to solving the problem by discussing it with ChatGPT.

Here's the chat link: <https://chat.openai.com/share/b2b5180c-f0fd-4b77-96d0-0907e0da6f31>. The text is also below.

> In Spring Boot 3.2.0, how do I automatically set the content length header for HttpHeaders, HttpEntity, and RestTemplate?

> As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, there is no version of Spring Boot labeled as "3.2.0". The latest stable version at that time was Spring Boot 2.6.1. If there have been updates or changes since then, I recommend checking the official Spring Boot documentation or release notes for the specific version you're referring to.

> In general, to automatically set the content length header in Spring Boot, you can use `RestTemplate` and `HttpHeaders` as follows:
>
> ```java
> RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
>
> HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
> headers.setContentLength(yourContentLength); // Set your actual content length value
>
> HttpEntity<String> requestEntity = new HttpEntity<>(yourRequestBody, headers);
>
> ResponseEntity<String> responseEntity = restTemplate.exchange(
>         yourUrl,
>         HttpMethod.POST,  // or HttpMethod.GET, depending on your request type
>         requestEntity,
>         String.class
> );
> ```
>
> Make sure to replace placeholders like `yourContentLength`, `yourRequestBody`, `yourUrl` with your actual values. If there have been updates or changes in the newer version you're using, check the documentation for any specific changes or additions.

> ## ChatGPT
>
> To calculate the content length for a given request body when it's a POJO (Plain Old Java Object), you can convert the POJO to its corresponding JSON representation and then determine the length of that JSON string. Here's an example using Jackson for JSON serialization:
>
> ```java
> import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;
>
> // Assuming you have a POJO class, let's call it MyRequestPojo
> MyRequestPojo requestPojo = new MyRequestPojo(/* initialize with your data */);
>
> // Convert POJO to JSON
> ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
> String jsonRequestBody = objectMapper.writeValueAsString(requestPojo);
>
> // Calculate content length
> int contentLength = jsonRequestBody.getBytes().length;
>
> // Now, you can use 'contentLength' in your HttpHeaders
> ```
>
> Replace `MyRequestPojo` with the actual class of your POJO. This example uses Jackson for JSON serialization; make sure to include the necessary Jackson dependencies in your project.
>
> Keep in mind that the actual content length can be affected by encoding, so if you are dealing with non-ASCII characters, you may need to consider the character encoding when calculating the length. The example above assumes UTF-8 encoding, which is commonly used for JSON.

> ## User
>
> Can I use the object mapper to get the byte length without converting the POJO to a String? If so, how?

> ## ChatGPT
>
> As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, Jackson's `ObjectMapper` directly serializes the object to a byte array without the need to convert it to a String first. You can use the `writeValueAsBytes` method for this purpose. Here's an example:
>
> ```java
> import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;
>
> // Assuming you have a POJO class, let's call it MyRequestPojo
> MyRequestPojo requestPojo = new MyRequestPojo(/* initialize with your data */);
>
> // Convert POJO to byte array
> ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
> byte[] jsonBytes = objectMapper.writeValueAsBytes(requestPojo);
>
> // Calculate content length
> int contentLength = jsonBytes.length;
>
> // Now, you can use 'contentLength' in your HttpHeaders
> ```

> This approach avoids the intermediate step of converting the JSON to a String, providing a more efficient way to calculate the content length directly from the byte array representation of the serialized JSON. Always ensure you are using the appropriate character encoding for your use case when dealing with non-ASCII characters.
