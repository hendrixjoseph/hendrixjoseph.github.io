Last month, I didn't read any books to my kids. This month, I read four books to my daughter and one book to my son.

I also read two books for myself.

Here are the four books I read to my daughter:

* Disney Villains Maleficent
* Dolphin Tale 2: A Tale of Winter and Hope
* Put Me in the Zoo
* The Kids Book of Poop

And this is the book I read to my son:

* There's Nothing to Do!

As for me, I read [The Moon is a Harsh Mistress](https://www.amazon.com/Moon-Harsh-Mistress-Robert-Heinlein-ebook/dp/B07CWGBZ4R/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) by Robert A. Heinlein and [Origin Uncertain: Unraveling the Mysteries of Etymology](https://www.amazon.com/Origin-Uncertain-Unraveling-Mysteries-Etymology/dp/0197664911/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) by Anatoly Liberman.

*The Moon is a Harsh Mistress* is about Lunar colonies liberating themselves from Earth, guided by an AI named Mike. Having an AI, it made the book shockingly relevant to today despite being written 60 years ago. The English (as in the language, the writing) was a bit odd - I *think* it was some sort of future-speech, as the book is written in first-person, but I'm not entirely sure.

*Origin Uncertain* talked about words and phrases that etymologists aren't certain about the origin. The title comes from what dictionaries will often say when unsure about a word's origin. While interesting, the writing was a bit harder to read than what I typically read.
