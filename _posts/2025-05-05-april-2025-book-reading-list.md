Four months of 2025 are in the books. And speaking of books, here's April's book reading list.

I almost didn't read any books to my son - after all, he's been reading the [Magic Tree House series](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Magic+Tree+House+books&tag=hendrixjoseph-20) on his own. But on the last day of April he brought two books to me and asked me to read them to him. How could I say no?

I also read seven books to my daughter.

I read twenty-three books for myself! But that's only because I've been reading the Magic Tree House, too. My son gets a kick out of the fact we've been reading the same books.

## Books I Read to My Son

* Have Fun, Molly Lou Melon
* The Pirate of Kindergarten

## Books I Read to My Daughter

* Barbie in the Pink Shoes Ballet Dreams
* Goodnight Little Wendy
* How to Find the Tooth Fairy
* I Love You A Rebus Poem
* One fish two fish red fish blue fish
* The Bears' Christmas
* Ty's Travels: All Aboard!

## The Book I Read for Me

I read one non-fiction book - [Spanish Grammar for Dummies](https://www.amazon.com/Spanish-Grammar-Dummies-Cecie-Kraynak/dp/1118023803/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) - to accompany my Duolingo Spanish practice.

I then began reading the same Magic Tree House series my son is reading. I read the first twenty-two books in the series. Each follows a similar plot-structure - each has exactly ten chapters. In fact, each chapter follows a similar structure in each book, especially the first and last chapter.

The first 22 books in the series are:

1. [Dinosaurs Before Dark](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Dinosaurs+Before+Dark&i=stripbooks&tag=hendrixjoseph-20)

The general plot structure is two children travel through time and space, visiting and experience various historical events, via a magic tree house owned by Morgan le Fay. It's almost as if Morgan le Fay is a Time Lord and the tree house is a TARDIS - the tree house even spins as it travels. However, Morgan le Fay doesn't accompany the two kids on their journeys.
