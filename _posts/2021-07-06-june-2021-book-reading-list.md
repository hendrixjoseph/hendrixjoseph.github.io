Recently I discovered [the Libby app](https://libbyapp.com/) - essentially free ebooks via my library. I've been reading a lot of magazines with it, and was able to read the first two books on this list for free as well.

The other three are free ebooks I snagged from Amazon's site. From time to time, authors give away their ebooks for free on Amazon.

I will say the *Passive Income* was mostly BS. I mean, yeah, it did provide ways to make money, but in no way are you going to be able to "say goodbye to your boss in **less than 6 months** and travel the world while the money flows in." And I already do a number of the things it mentions, anyhow.

What have you read in the past month? Be sure to let me know in the comments below!
