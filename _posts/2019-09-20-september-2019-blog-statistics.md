Three more of this blog stat reports, and I'll have two year's worth of monthly reports - the first report was on [January 2018](https://www.joehxblog.com/january-2018-blog-statistics/).

Speaking of which, I've created [a spreadsheet containing all the blog stats so far](https://github.com/hendrixjoseph/hendrixjoseph.github.io/blob/master/_data/blog-stats.csv), so you can, if you want, see everything at a glance. I don't include stats that are derived from other stats (basically, the ratios). Also, any blank spots mean either I didn't record that specific statistic, or it wasn't available that month.

This is also the second blog stat report since [my change in domain](https://www.joehxblog.com/rebrand-part-ii-changing-my-domain-name/). I'll continue to report how that's affected my stats.

I was able to publish eight posts this month:

## Alexa

Alexa still has data for both [the old hendrixjoseph.github.io domain](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/hendrixjoseph.github.io) and [the new joehxblog.com domain](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/joehxblog.com). I'm rather surprised that the old domain is holding onto its Alexa rank.

### Alexa Ranking for the old hendrixjoseph.github.io

## Google Search Console

With Google Search Console, the old domain is trending down, as expected, while the new domain continues to get most of the numbers. I'm surprised the old domain still has any values, to be honest.
