I'm publishing this blog stats post two days early this month - I'm going to be out at Cub Scout camp with my son the next few days. That means this is the first time *in over seven years* since I started publishing these blog stats posts that I won't be publishing on the 20th.

Oh well, time spent with my son is more important than this blog!

I only published one post: [May 2025 Book Reading List](https://www.joehxblog.com/may-2025-book-reading-list/).

## Ratios

Note the for the "day" part of the ratios below there's only 29 days instead of the normal 31 due to publishing two days early.

* Earnings / 1,000 users = $5.75 / 1.6 = $3.59
* Earnings / 1,000 views = $5.75 / 2.0 = $2.88
* Earnings / 1,000 impressions = $5.75 / 6.396 = $0.90
* Earnings / day = $5.75 / 29 = $0.20
* Users / day = 1,600 / 29 = 55.2
* Views / day = 2,000 / 29 = 69.0
* Impressions / day = 6,396 / 29 = 220.6
