Last month I finished reading [The Cuckoo's Egg](https://www.amazon.com/CUCKOOS-EGG-Clifford-Stoll-ebook/dp/B0083DJXCM/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) by Cliff Stoll. It's the true story of on of the first documented spy attempts through the Internet and other networks. Although it's written in - and from the perspective of - the late 1980s, it is still relevant to today.

I'd highly recommend it to anyone. And even non-technical people would enjoy it - it expects no understanding of technical or hacking jargon, and explains it as it goes.

At the end there's a bibliography, so I figured I'd help out future readers and link to the various books and articles it references.

First, Mr. Stoll lists a couple of articles he wrote from his experience described in the book. There's [Stalking the Wily Hacker](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/42411.42412) (also [available on textfiles.com](http://pdf.textfiles.com/academics/wilyhacker.pdf), an awesome site on its own) from [the May 1988 issue of the Communications of the ACM](https://dl.acm.org/toc/cacm/1988/31/5). And there's [What Do You Feed a Trojan Horse?](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/conference-paper/1987/09/21/proceedings-10th-national-computer-security-conference-1987/documents/1987-10th-NCSC-proceedings.pdf#page=240) (on page 240, which the link should take you directly to) in the [Proceedings of the 10th National Computer Security Conference (September 1987)](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/conference-paper/1987/09/21/proceedings-10th-national-computer-security-conference-1987).

He also mentions [Defending Secrets, Sharing Data: New Locks and Keys for Electronic Information](https://ota.fas.org/reports/8706.pdf) (which he says is "available from the U.S. Congress, Office of Technology Assessment, OTA-CIT-310" but the link I provided is from the [Office of Technology Assessment Archive](https://ota.fas.org/).

As to books, he lists the following:

* [The Puzzle Palace by James Bamford](https://www.amazon.com/Puzzle-Palace-National-Intelligence-Organization/dp/0140067485/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20)
