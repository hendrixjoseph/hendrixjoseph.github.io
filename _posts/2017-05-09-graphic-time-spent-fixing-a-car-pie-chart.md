This is just a quick pie chart illustrating the time spent when ever I am working on either my car or friend and family's car.

The isn't the time spent at a mechanic's shop. This is DIY "[shadetree mechanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadetree_mechanic)" stuff.

<div id="time-pie"></div>
<script>c3.generate({bindto:"#time-pie",data:{columns:[["running around for parts",60],["looking for that tool YOU JUST HAD IN YOUR HAND",15],["taking a quick break",60],["swearing",20],["wondering where that 10mm socket went",10],["soaking a rusted bolt in PB Blaster",20],["actually working on the car",5]],type:"pie"}});</script>
