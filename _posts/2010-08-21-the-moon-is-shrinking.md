> Simply stated, the moon is shrinking.

> According to a recent scientific study, including images taken by NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, or the LRO, the lunar surface has revealed a series of geologic faults that weren’t seen before.
>
> These small faults, which are caused by internal cooling of the moon, have been discovered all over the moon, said Thomas Watters, a planetary geologist at the Center for Earth and Planetary Studies of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.

Until next time
