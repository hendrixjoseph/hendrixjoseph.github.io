New Year's Goals Resolutions & Goals is more my wife's thing - I will set goals throughout the year instead of waiting for a specific date to set them - but it's good for us to get together and discuss where we want to be.

We've been doing this for at least the past five years. Here's the last five I've posted on this blog:
