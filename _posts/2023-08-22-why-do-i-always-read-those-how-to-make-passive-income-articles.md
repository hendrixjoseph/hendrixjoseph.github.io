Why do i always read those "How to Make Passive Income" news articles and blog posts?

They always say the same thing.

## Invest in dividend stocks

Yeah, I know. I already do this with [Robinhood](https://www.joehxblog.com/robinhood/), [Webull](https://www.joehxblog.com/webull/) to a lesser extent, and of course good old Vanguard and Fidelity with those tax-advantaged accounts otherwise known as a 401k and IRA of the Roth variety.

And, ignoring the fact I already do this, "dividend stocks" might not be the best stocks to invest in.

## Put your money in a high-yield savings account.

Hello, Ally. That's my go-to savings at something like 4% right now? I don't know - they keep raising it. Which is good, except it means that inflation has been rising, too.

Plus, my local credit union pays something like 7% on the first so-much I have in their savings account.

And - get this - putting money in a high-yield savings account isn't that different from "investing in dividend stocks." You have to have money first. Thankfully, I'm at a point in my life that I do. Is it luck? Fortune? Privilege?

## Write a blog

You're here. I'm doing that. And I do make money with Google Adsense and Amazon Associates. But only around $100 a month. Which isn't too bad, considering I spend... $12 a year on the domain?

## Create digital products

Check out my two books on Amazon:

* [The Adventures of Princess (The Adventures of Princess and Niko Book 1)](https://www.amazon.com/Adventures-Princess-Niko-Book-ebook/dp/B07M68STB4/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20)
* [The Adventures of Niko (The Adventures of Princess and Niko Book 2)](https://www.amazon.com/Adventures-Niko-Princess-Book-ebook/dp/B07SRJTTMW/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20)

Both of which I've sold zero copies, netting me a whopping zero commission.

I also got some icons available for purchase over at [the Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/joehx/). I've made ten or so dollars over the last ten or so years.

Nothing amazing, but I'm doing it.

## Print-on-demand

Yep. I do this, too.

I got two low-content books on Amazon, both of which haven't sold a single copy:

* [Farm Animals Coloring Book For Toddlers and Preschoolers: Chickens, Pigs, Horses, Frogs, & More](https://www.amazon.com/Farm-Animals-Coloring-Toddlers-Preschoolers/dp/B0BJ7XVL9D/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20)
* [100 Sudoku Puzzles: 25 Easy · 25 Medium · 25 Hard · 25 Very Hard with Solutions Included](https://www.amazon.com/100-Sudoku-Puzzles-Solutions-Included/dp/1707062951/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20)

I've got [t-shirts and other stuff on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=joehx&tag-hendrixjoseph-20) and [t-shirts on TeePublic](https://www.teepublic.com/user/joehx). But whenever I sit down to design a shirt, my mind goes blank...

## Will I keep reading "How to Make Passive Income" articles

Probably.
