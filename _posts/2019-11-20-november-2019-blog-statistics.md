## Alexa

The [Alexa data for the old hendrixjoseph.github.io domain](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/hendrixjoseph.github.io) finally dropped off, although Alexa still reports that there are 62 "Total Sites Linking In."

On the new domain, my Global Rank is down about 20,000 (which is good) but my US Rank is up about 20,000 (which is not good).

I am starting to pick up "sites linking in."

## Google Search Console

The old domain is pretty much dead in Google Search Console. The single-click I did get wasn't even to my blog - instead, it was to [this  JavaDoc from an old school project](https://www.joehxblog.com/FamilyTree/apidocs/edu/wright/hendrix11/familyTree/entity/Person.html).

The new domain is down from [last month](https://www.joehxblog.com/october-2019-blog-statistics/) - where I had 794 clicks - and down from [September](https://www.joehxblog.com/september-2019-blog-statistics/) as well - where I had 428 clicks.

I still had plenty of clicks, though.
