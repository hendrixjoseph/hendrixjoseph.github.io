On to year six of these monthly book reading lists!

I read a total of 34 different books to my son, whereas I only read a total of 10 different books to my daughter.

And I was able to finish a whopping *3* books for myself.

## Books I Read to My Children

### Books I Read to My Son

My son has recently gotten into the [Elephant and Piggie](https://www.amazon.com/Elephant-Piggie-Complete-Collection-Book/dp/136802131X/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) books by [Mo Williems](https://www.amazon.com/stores/Mo-Willems/author/B004LUYA1U/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). And my wife and I haven't just been reading them to him - *he's been reading them with us and to himself*. The little guy isn't even five years old yet!

A week or so ago my wife brought home a stack of them from the library. When my son say that stack, he made me read him each and every one.

Here are the 11 Elephant and Piggie I've to (& with) my son in January:

## The Books I Read for Me

I managed to finish three books. The third "book" is kind of cheating, since it turned out to be a short story.
