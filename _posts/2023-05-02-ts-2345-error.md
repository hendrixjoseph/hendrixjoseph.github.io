So earlier today I had defined a little validation function type in TypeScript:

```typescript
type validated =  (valid: boolean) => {};
```

In my mind, the above type describes a function that takes a boolean and returns nothing. After all, it looks similar to the following JavaScript function:

```javascript
valid => {};
```

But when I tried to use it, I got a TS 2345 error: `Type 'void' is not assignable to type '{}'`.

Um, ok, aren't I returning nothing... As in, `void`?

Well, no, those double-curly brackets were more like an empty *Object* and less the brackets around an empty function body.

So I was saying I was essentially returning something like the following:

```javascript
let object = {};
```

The solution? change `() => {}` to `() => void`:

```typescript
type validated =  (valid: boolean) => void;
```
