Last year, she wanted [an Ariel cake](https://www.joehxblog.com/an-ariel-cake-for-my-daughters-birthday/). This year? A Rapunzel cake.

Which is odd considering she's into Elsa.

But she asked for a *Rapunzel* cake, so a Rapunzel cake is what she got.

This cake was rather simple:

* I used [vanilla white icing](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=vanilla+white+icing&tag=hendrixjoseph-20) with red and blue food dye to make a light purple color
* I twisted some [fondant](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=fondant&tag=hendrixjoseph-20) into a braid then painted it with yellow food coloring.
* I bought a [small Rapunzel doll](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=small+rapunzel+doll&tag=hendrixjoseph-20) and placed her, on top of a piece of cardboard to keep her clean, onto the top right section of the cake.
* I had my wife write my daughter's name on the cake.

And here's the final product:
