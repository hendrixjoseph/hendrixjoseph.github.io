2025 is here. Now that 2024 is complete, I can look and see how much I made doing things outside of normal employment.

This will be the second year I've done it in the beginning of January instead of the end of December, and the ninth year of doing it in general.

Here are the past eight income reports:

* [2023 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2023-end-of-year-side-income-report/)
* [2022 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2022-end-of-year-side-income-report/)
* [2021 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2021-end-of-year-side-income-report/)
* [2020 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2020-end-of-year-side-income-report/)
* [2019 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2019-end-of-year-side-income-report/)
* [2018 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2018-end-of-year-side-income-report/)
* [2017 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2017-end-of-year-side-income-report/)
* [2016 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2016-end-of-year-side-income-report/)

## Credit Card Rewards

* Citi Double Cash &rarr; $904.61
* Chase Freedom &rarr; $355.56
* [Chase Freedom Flex](https://www.joehxblog.com/chase-freedom/) &rarr; $782.25
* [Chase Freedom Unlimited](https://www.joehxblog.com/chase-freedom-unlimited/) &rarr; $177.39
* US Bank Cash+ &rarr; $114.59
* [Capital One Quicksilver](https://www.joehxblog.com/capital-one-quicksilver/) &rarr; $13.86
* Verizon Visa &rarr; $100.00
* Total &rarr; $2,448.26

The Citi Double Cash gets me 2% cash back on everything, so it's my base card.

The Chase Freedom and Freedom Flex I use almost exclusively on the rotating 5% cash back categories. I will also use them, along with the Chase Freedom Unlimited, whenever there's a good Chase offer.

The US Bank Cash+ is used for my Internet and my utilities (gas & electric).

I used to use it for my cell phone bill, but I picked up the Verizon Visa card. That gets me an effective 4% back on gas, groceries, and restaurants, but it's in "Verizon Dollars" which can only be used on my Verizon bill. I don't count that as income in this report. The $100 above is from the sign-up bonus which was a credit to the card, not Verizon dollars.

## Interest-Bearing Accounts

* Ally Interest &rarr;  $2,445.46
* Vanguard &rarr; $1,062.38
* Credit Union Interest &rarr; $479.58
* [Robinhood](https://www.joehxblog.com/robinhood/)
  * Dividends &rarr; $229.50
  * Stock Lending &rarr; $1.41
* Treasury Direct &rarr; $1,259.71
* [Arrived Homes](https://arrivedhomes.com/) &rarr; $9.71
* [Worthy Bonds](https://www.joehxblog.com/worthybonds/) &rarr; $11.88
* [WeBull Dividends](https://www.joehxblog.com/webull/) &rarr; $1.52
* Total &rarr; $5,501.15

*Interest-Bearing* means anything that I may receive a 1099-INT or 1099-DIV for. In other words - bank account interest and dividends.

## Print-On-Demand Sites

* [Merch by Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=%22joehx%22&i=fashion&tag=hendrixjoseph-20) &rarr; $874.29
* [TeePublic](https://www.joehxblog.com/teepublic/) &rarr; $44.85
* Amazon Kindle Direct &rarr; $14.69
* Total &rarr; $933.83

I published [a couple of word search books back in July](https://www.joehxblog.com/announcing-my-newest-creations-two-exciting-word-search-puzzle-books/) - [The Ultimate Cybersecurity Word Search Puzzle Book](https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Cybersecurity-Word-Search-Puzzle/dp/B0D7MYZB7Y/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) and [The Ultimate Programming Word Search Puzzle Book](https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Programming-Word-Search-Puzzle/dp/B0D9241RQD/). Of the two, only the Cybersecurity has sold. That's where the $14.69 from Amazon Kindle Direct come from (even though they're physical books, not Kindle books).

## Blogging

* Google AdSense &rarr; $104.15
* Amazon Associates &rarr; $13.49
* Paid Back Link &rarr; $97.01
* Total &rarr; $214.65

## Cryptocurrency Earnings

* [Coinbase](https://www.joehxblog.com/coinbase/)
  * Rewards &rarr; $36.99
  * Staking &rarr; $2.61
  * Capital Gains &rarr; $3,215.56
* BlockFi Capital Loses &rarr; -$1,771.45
* Total &rarr; $1,483.71

I finally got money back from BlockFi. Unfortunately, it was only a fraction of what I invested. So that amount is negative - a loss.

Back in March I sold 0.1 bitcoin when it was trading somewhere in the $60,000 range. In retrospect, I should have waited unit it hit $100,000 in December. That said, I didn't sell *all* of it. The number for the capital gains isn't six-thousand-something because the cost basis was roughly half that.

## Miscellaneous

* Cloud Research &rarr; $284.53
* Data Annotation &rarr; $165.70
* Programming Work &rarr; $9,757.13
* Vitality Rebate &rarr; $450.00

$21,455.31 is more than double last year's number ($9,060.98). Does that mean next year I'm going to make over $50k? We'll see!
