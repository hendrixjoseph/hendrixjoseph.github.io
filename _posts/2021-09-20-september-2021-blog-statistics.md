Time is just flying by. I barely noticed it was the twentieth - and almost forgot about my monthly blog stats post.

But I've been doing these regularly for over three years now, and I don't want to stop now.

This post, though, is just going to be a lazy here-are-the-numbers post.

I published five posts on the blog in the past month:

* [Interesting Reads for the Week Ending September 3rd](https://www.joehxblog.com/september-4-2021-interesting-reads/)
* [August 2021 Book Reading List](https://www.joehxblog.com/august-2021-book-reading-list/)
* [How to Sort Multiple Posts on One Date in Jekyll](https://www.joehxblog.com/sort-multiple-posts-on-one-date-in-jekyll/)
* [Here's What Books These 5 Influential Libertarians Recommend](https://www.joehxblog.com/5-books-recommended-by-libertarians/)
