I really feel like, as my kids get older, me reading to them is winding down.

My son is functionally literate. He can read. He can write. And he only just finished kindergarten.

My daughter - who still has another year of preschool before kindergarten - can't read or write. But she knows her letters.

So I read less and less to my son as he reads more and more to himself. And sometimes he even reads to his sister. I only managed to read two books to him.

I did read eleven books to my daughter.

I've been doing these book reading lists since two months before he was born. Eventually I'll just be talking about what I read.

## Books I Read to My Children

## The Books I Read for Me

I began reading Isaac Asimov's Foundation series. I'm reading them in chronological order - so I began with [Prelude to Foundation](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003EY7JH6?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). I have to say that the double-twist at the end was well-played.

For non-fiction, I read [The 99% Invisible City: A Field Guide to the Hidden World of Everyday Design](https://www.amazon.com/99-Invisible-City-Hidden-Everyday-ebook/dp/B086YHKSJX/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20).

Currently I'm waiting on a hold in the Libby app for the second Foundation book. Hopefully I get it and can finish it in time for next month's book reading list.
