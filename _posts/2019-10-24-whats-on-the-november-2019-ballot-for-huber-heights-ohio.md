I've put together (what I hope is) a handy guide to the November 2019 ballot for Huber Heights, Ohio. The purpose of this guide *isn't* to tell people who or what they should vote for, but rather only to let people know who or what is on the ballot.

## A Bit of Background

In my early days of voting, there was always at least one thing - one candidate or one issue - that I didn't know of until I was actually at the ballot box.

It didn't matter how hard I searched or tried to be informed, this was a constant occurrence every year.

At some point, [sample ballots for Montgomery Country, Ohio](https://montgomery.ohioboe.com/apps/ballotlist.aspx) appeared online. I'm not sure how long exactly - the oldest "sample ballots" on the site are from the primaries on May 6, 2014. I've been using it for at least as long.

While the site is extremely useful, it is not user-friendly. It looks as if the site actually lists all sample ballots in Ohio, but I couldn't even find a [directory of all Ohio Sample Ballot Links by County](https://www.joehxblog.com/tools/ohio-sample-ballot-links-by-county/).

Hopefully, my little guide is more user-friendly and doesn't confuse anyone!

## Huber Heights Wards and Precincts

Huber Heights is divided into six wards, each with their own elected representative (known as a council member). Furthermore, each ward is divided into three or more precincts or election districts.

The wards are numbered one through six. The precincts are lettered A through D. A precinct is identified by the number-letter combination of its ward and precinct. For instance, Precinct A of Ward 1 is identified as *1-A*.

Two of the letter-level precincts are split into two precincts (namely precinct 1-D is split into 1-D1 and 1-D2, and 5-B is split into 5-B1 and 5-B2).

## Organization of The Following

I've identified what is unique for each ballot. For instance, I noticed that the Ward 1 representative was only on ballots for people in Ward 1 (as expected). I only list what is unique underneath Ward 1.

I have a section for what is common to all ballots in Huber Heights.

When the ballot lists multiple people, I have them sorted by their last name.
