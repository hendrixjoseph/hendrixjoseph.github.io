Another month is in the books. Now it's time for my monthly book reading list.

I read less and less books to my son the more and more he is able to read to himself. He really enjoys reading the [Piggie and Elephant](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=piggie+and+elephant+books&tag=hendrixjoseph-20) series of books by [Mo Willems](https://www.amazon.com/stores/Mo-Willems/author/B004LUYA1U?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). 

So I only ended up reading five different books to my son.

My daughter, however, I was able to read sixteen different books.

I read three or four books for myself.

## The Books I Read for Me

I say I read three or four books for myself because I lost track. I believe I read [For Profit: A History of Corporations by William Magnuson](https://www.amazon.com/Profit-History-Corporations-William-Magnuson-ebook/dp/B09V11H7GB/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) back in [January](https://www.joehxblog.com/january-2024-book-reading-list/) or [February](/february-2024-book-reading-list/), but look at those posts I didn't mention it.

I know I did read [Planet of the Apes by Pierre Boulle](https://www.amazon.com/Planet-Apes-Novel-Pierre-Boulle-ebook/dp/B004JHYK7O/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20), [The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel](https://www.amazon.com/Psychology-Money-Timeless-lessons-happiness-ebook/dp/B084HJSJJ2/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20), and [Happy Habits for Every Couple by Kathi Lipp](https://www.amazon.com/Happy-Habits-Every-Couple-Kathi-ebook/dp/B00QMMAK7S/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20).

*The Psychology of Money* was better than I expected. It wasn't just raw data - it also included a decent amount of anecdotes to make its point. Or rather, it's points, since it makes several.

*Happy Habits for Every Couple* was ok, but it seemed to be biased towards stereotypical men and stereotypical women. Men who like sports and women who like shopping - which is not how my wife and I are. It did actively try not to be biased in this area, but it was.

*Planet of the Apes* was good, but it was a product of when it was written. Despite being in set in the future, the was a bit of casual racism that I don't remember happening in [the classic Charlton Heston movie](https://www.amazon.com/Planet-Apes-Charlton-Heston/dp/B0053EZWOW/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20).
