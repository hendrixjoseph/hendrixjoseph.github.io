Interesting in the new Google Pixel 8a? 

The 128 gigabyte version is available on Amazon right not for $499, and it comes with a free $100 Amazon gift card, making it cost a net $399:

The offer ends on May 19th, 2024 - which is Sunday.

Also, don't forget to get a phone case. I like the [OtterBox Commuter Series](https://www.amazon.com/OtterBox-Google-Pixel-Commuter-Case/dp/B0D1GV39P2/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20).
