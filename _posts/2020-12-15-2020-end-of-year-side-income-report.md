Side income. Side job. Side hustle. Whatever you call it, it's money not from my main, 9-5 job. And, now that it's the last month of 2020, it's time for my annual end-of-year side income report.

This is the fifth year I've been writing these income reports. The previous four reports are:

* [2019 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2019-end-of-year-side-income-report/)
* [2018 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2018-end-of-year-side-income-report/)
* [2017 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2017-end-of-year-side-income-report/)
* [2016 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2016-end-of-year-side-income-report/)

I've grouped my side income into four categories: cash back & receipt apps, credit card rewards, interest-bearing accounts, print-on-demand sites, blogging, and miscellaneous.

I've also included a cryptocurrency section for any earnings in cryptocurrency.

## Cash Back & Receipt Apps

* [Receipt Hog](https://www.receipthog.com/) &rarr; $40.00
* [eBates/Rakuten](https://www.joehxblog.com/ebates/) &rarr; $17.09
* [Bumped](https://bumped.com/) &rarr; $130.14 $330 - $14.07 - $185.79
* [Bits of Stock](https://bitsofstock.com/) &rarr; $47.22
* Total &rarr; $234.45

I'm not sure Bits of Stock will ever payout, but supposedly I have almost fifty dollars in stock with that app.

Bumped significantly changed their earnings method, which made them effectively dead. I'm in the process of [moving my stock choices from them to another provider](https://www.joehxblog.com/moving-my-stocks-from-bumped-to-robinhood-in-five-days/) - which, unfortunately involves selling my assets in Bumped and rebuying them elsewhere.

I also have [Dosh](https://www.joehxblog.com/dosh/) and [Drop](https://www.joehxblog.com/drop/), but I haven't made anything of substance with those two yet.

## Credit Card Rewards

* [Chase Freedom Unlimited](https://www.joehxblog.com/chase-freedom-unlimited/) &rarr; $289.25
* [Chase Freedom Flex](https://www.joehxblog.com/chase-freedom/) &rarr; $284.38
* Chase Freedom &rarr; $326.46
* US Bank Cash+ &rarr; $67.57
* [Capital One Quicksilver](https://www.joehxblog.com/capital-one/) &rarr; $14.40
* Citi Double Cash &rarr; $564.40 + ?
* Total &rarr; $1546.46

New this year is my [Chase Freedom Flex](https://www.joehxblog.com/chase-freedom/), meaning I earned $300 from opening that card. $200 was from the card itself, and the other $100 was from the referral bonus my wife earned. You too can earn an extra $200 by signing up for either the [Chase Freedom Flex](https://www.joehxblog.com/chase-freedom/) or [Chase Freedom Unlimited](https://www.joehxblog.com/chase-freedom-unlimited/) using one of the links.

The Chase Freedom (which I often called "Chase Freedom Regular") is no longer available - however since I still have the card, it still works and earns 5% on rotating categories.

My Citi Double Cash - which earns an effective 2% - has been used less since the Chase cards now earn 3% on restaurants, and my Chase Freedom Flex is earning 5% on grocery (for the first year anyway). Also, the Double Cash requires at least $25 before I can cash out, so I still have $12.93 in unclaimed cash back. That balance will be added to next month's balance, so I'm not losing it.

The Chase cards have no such minute. There have been many times where I redeemed less than a dollar into my bank account.

## Interest-Bearing Accounts

* [Robinhood](https://www.joehxblog.com/robinhood/) &rarr; $14.53
* [WeBull](https://www.joehxblog.com/webull/) &rarr; $1.23
* [Worthy Bonds](https://www.joehxblog.com/worthybonds/) &rarr; $2.24
* Credit Union Interest &rarr; $98.11
* Ally Interest &rarr; $162.51
* Total &rarr; $278.62

For the purpose of this section, *interest-bearing accounts* include dividend earnings along with more traditional savings accounts.

My credit union savings account earns 6% on the first $500. It used to earn 3%, but they [doubled that almost two years ago](https://www.joehxblog.com/wright-patt-credit-union-quietly-doubles-truesaver-rate/) amidst rising interest rates.

Thankfully they haven't lowered it back down, even as interest rates lower, including on my Ally account.

## Print-On-Demand Sites

* Merch by Amazon &rarr; $974.71
* Kindle Direct Publishing &rarr; $0.00
* [Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com/people/joehx) &rarr; $69.80
* [TeePublic](https://www.joehxblog.com/teepublic/) &rarr; $115.75
* [Teespring](https://teespring.com/stores/joehxs-store) &rarr; $12.00
* Total &rarr; $1172.25

Since I have one payment left this year for Merch by Amazon, and perhaps one from RedBubble, this section doesn't include everything.

The Amazon payment isn't until the 29th, so I wouldn't have time to do this post after that payment hits my bank account.

I do know what my December payment will be, so I could add that, but it includes £2.22 and €19.43 and I don't know what the conversion will be. (The dollar amount is $56.59.)

## Blogging

* Amazon Associates &rarr; $218.06
* Square Cash Referrals &rarr; $1,060.00
* Google AdSense &rarr; $121.48
* [Worthy Bond Referral](https://www.joehxblog.com/worthybonds/) &rarr; $10.00
* [WeBull Bonuses & Referrals](https://www.joehxblog.com/webull/) &rarr; $166.02
* Total &rarr; $1,575.56

The Square Cash Referrals came from an odd occurrence where [I received over 1,600 referrals in one weekend](https://www.joehxblog.com/square-closed-my-cash-app-after-i-received-over-1600-referrals-in-one-weekend/). At ten bucks a referral, that means I received $16,000 in referrals, but I was only able to withdrawal $1,060 before they closed my account. If they send me a 1099 tax form, hopefully they only put the amount I actually got.

I received my first AdSense payment this year. Amazingly enough, my balance is already at seventy-some dollars, so it shouldn't take as long to get my next payment.

Similar to Merch by Amazon, Amazon Associates pays out on the 29th. I have a balance somewhere around $20 right now, but I won't know for certain how much I get paid until I get paid.
