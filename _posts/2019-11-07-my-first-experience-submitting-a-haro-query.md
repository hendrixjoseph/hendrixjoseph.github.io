I recently signed up for (three-time) daily emails from [HARO](http://www.helpareporter.com/), trying to score some backlinks.

After receiving the emails for a week or so, I wondered if I could instead use HARO to score some content instead. You see, unlike this site, I struggle a bit for content on my other blog [Puppy Snuggles](https://www.puppy-snuggles.com/).

So I decided to submit a HARO query as a blogger.

## What is HARO?

HARO - or Help a Reporter Out - is a service that sends out emails three times daily with requests from journalists, writers, and bloggers for information from "experts" - really just the general public - for responses on a variety of topics.

Here's how HARO touts there service on their website:

> HARO provides journalists with a robust database of sources for upcoming stories and daily opportunities for sources to secure valuable media coverage.

## How I used HARO

HARO's [rules for journalists, bloggers, and writers](https://www.helpareporter.com/journalists/rules/) gave two specific conditions for a website to use the service:

1. It's Alexa ranking must be under 1,000,000 (that's one million).
2. It must be launched for at least one month.

Well, I launched [Puppy Snuggles in February 2017](https://www.joehxblog.com/presenting-the-puppy-snuggles-webpage/) - that's almost three years ago!

[Puppy Snuggles' Alexa rank](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/puppy-snuggles.com) seems to dance around the one million mark. At the time of this writing, it's sitting at 956,258.

Confident I could submit a HARO query, I thought up a puppy-related question that I thought might get some responses.

So, on Monday, October 28, 2019, I submitted the following to HARO:

> Title: hat is the cutest thing your dog has done?
>
> Query: I'm looking for dog owners to tell me in one or two sentences what is the cutest thing your dog has done.
>
> Requirements: All dog owners, preferably those with blogs themselves. Please also provide a link to an image of your dog, your dog's name, and your name. Thank you!

On Wednesday, October 30, 2019, I received an email stating that my HARO source request had been approved! My query was to go out on the Morning (5:35 am ET) HARO daily update email on Thursday, October 31, 2019.

## Pitches

I received 13 pitches directly via the HARO system. I also received another seven via a Google Form that I advertised outside the HARO system.

I used them all, although I did have to respond to some of the pitches for more information. This was mostly for pictures - people tried to attach them in the email, but HARO stripped the (cute doggy!) photos out.

Also, I should have specified that I wanted the names of their pooches as well, although most people provided this in the pitches anyway.

## Conclusion

Making the HARO query wasn't that hard, however, receiving and parsing the pitches was a little more work than I anticipated.

It was worth it, though.
