Here's what I read in May.

</ol>

I also read [Soonish: Ten Emerging Technologies That'll Improve and/or Ruin Everything](https://www.amazon.com/Soonish-Emerging-Technologies-Improve-Everything-ebook/dp/B06XBQ443G/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) by Kelly Weinersmith and Zach Weinersmith. Kelly and Zach (or maybe just Zach?) are the authors of the [Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal comics](https://www.smbc-comics.com/). *Soonish* in particular was published back in 2017. Being published eight years ago, some of the predictions are a bit dated. It's a book, however, that could enjoy a second (or even multiple!) editions over the years.

Finally, I read [Curly Girl: The Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/Curly-Girl-Handbook-Michele-Bender/dp/076115678X/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) by by Lorraine Massey and Michele Bender. [I have curly hair](https://old.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/1kwn7hv/year_and_a_half_of_growth/), and so does my daughter, so I wanted to learn a bit more how to maintain curly hair. The book itself, despite its name, is not specific to women's hair. The tone - especially with the intended audience - is, however, aimed at women (hence the title). That said, it does have a chapter about men's hair.
