Here's what I read in May.

## The Book I Read for Me

I read books 23 through 34 of the *Magic Tree House* series:

<ol start="23">
  <li>[Twister on Tuesday](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Twister+on+Tuesday&i=stripbooks&tag=hendrixjoseph-20)</li>
  <li>[Earthquake in the Early Morning](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Earthquake+in+the+Early+Morning&i=stripbooks&tag=hendrixjoseph-20)</li>

  <li>[Good Morning, Gorillas](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Good+Morning,+Gorillas&i=stripbooks&tag=hendrixjoseph-20)</li>
  <li>[Thanksgiving on Thursday](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Thanksgiving+on+Thursday&i=stripbooks&tag=hendrixjoseph-20)</li>
  <li>[High Tide in Hawaii](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=High+Tide+in+Hawaii&i=stripbooks&tag=hendrixjoseph-20)</li>
  <li>[A Big Day for Baseball](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=A+Big+Day+for+Baseball&i=stripbooks&tag=hendrixjoseph-20)</li>
  <li>[Hurricane Heroes in Texas](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Hurricane+Heroes+in+Texas&i=stripbooks&tag=hendrixjoseph-20)</li>
  <li>[Warriors in Winter](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Warriors+in+Winter&i=stripbooks&tag=hendrixjoseph-20)</li>
  <li>[To the Future, Ben Franklin!](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=To+the+Future+Ben+Franklin&i=stripbooks&tag=hendrixjoseph-20)</li>
  <li>[Narwhal on a Sunny Night](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Narwhal+on+a+Sunny+Night&i=stripbooks&tag=hendrixjoseph-20)</li>
  <li>[Late Lunch with Llamas](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Late+Lunch+with+Llamas&i=stripbooks&tag=hendrixjoseph-20)</li>
</ol>

I also read [Soonish: Ten Emerging Technologies That'll Improve and/or Ruin Everything](https://www.amazon.com/Soonish-Emerging-Technologies-Improve-Everything-ebook/dp/B06XBQ443G/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) by Kelly Weinersmith and Zach Weinersmith. Kelly and Zach (or maybe just Zach?) are the authors of the [Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal comics](https://www.smbc-comics.com/). *Soonish* in particular was published back in 2017. Being published eight years ago, some of the predictions are a bit dated. It's a book, however, that could enjoy a second (or even multiple!) editions over the years.

Finally, I read [Curly Girl: The Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/Curly-Girl-Handbook-Michele-Bender/dp/076115678X/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) by by Lorraine Massey and Michele Bender. [I have curly hair](https://old.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/1kwn7hv/year_and_a_half_of_growth/), and so does my daughter, so I wanted to learn a bit more how to maintain curly hair. The book itself, despite its name, is not specific to women's hair. The tone - especially with the intended audience - is, however, aimed at women (hence the title). That said, it does have a chapter about men's hair.
