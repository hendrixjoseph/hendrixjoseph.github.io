Time does fly. It was only this morning that I realized *it's already the twentieth*. And last week I realized *Christmas is barely a week away.*

So it's the twentieth - a time on this blog where I make my blog stats report.

I only wrote two posts in the past month:

* [2021 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2021-end-of-year-side-income-report/)
* [November 2021 Book Reading List](https://www.joehxblog.com/november-2021-book-reading-list/)

## Alexa
