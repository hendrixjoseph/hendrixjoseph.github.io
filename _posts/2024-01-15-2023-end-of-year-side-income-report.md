2023 has come and gone. That means I can now look at how much I made *on the side* last year.

Traditionally I've done these in the last few days of December. However, I've found that - even if I do it on the last of of the year - I end up missing a few numbers. This year, then, I'm doing it it January.

Here are the past seven income reports:

* [2022 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2022-end-of-year-side-income-report/)
* [2021 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2021-end-of-year-side-income-report/)
* [2020 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2020-end-of-year-side-income-report/)
* [2019 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2019-end-of-year-side-income-report/)
* [2018 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2018-end-of-year-side-income-report/)
* [2017 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2017-end-of-year-side-income-report/)
* [2016 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2016-end-of-year-side-income-report/)

## Credit Card Rewards

* Citi Double Cash &rarr; $1,288.41
* Chase Freedom &rarr; $453.90
* [Chase Freedom Flex](https://www.joehxblog.com/chase-freedom/) &rarr; $433.95
* [Chase Freedom Unlimited](https://www.joehxblog.com/chase-freedom-unlimited/) &rarr; $156.60
* US Bank Cash+ &rarr; $108.11
* [Capital One Quicksilver](https://www.joehxblog.com/capital-one/) &rarr; $13.86
* Total &rarr; $2,454.83

For context, the Citi Double Cash gets me 2% cash back on everything.

The Chase Freedom and Freedom Flex I use almost exclusively on the rotating 5% cash back categories. The Chase Freedom Unlimited gets me 3% at restaurants (really all the Chase cards here do) - I use that one when dining out instead of the others in case the restaurant (for whatever reason) doesn't code as a restaurant (in which case I'll get 1.5% instead).

The US Bank Cash+ is used for my Internet and cell phone bill, which nets me 5% cash back on those.

Finally, Capital One Quicksilver is sock-drawered - it only gets me 1.5% cash back. The only nice thing about it is there's no foreign transactions fees, so that's my go-to card the rare times I travel out of the country.

## Interest-Bearing Accounts

* Ally Interest &rarr;  $1,805.97
* Vanguard $347.29
* Credit Union Interest &rarr; $403.11
* [Robinhood](https://www.joehxblog.com/robinhood/)
  * Option Premiums &rarr; $265.54
  * Dividends &rarr; $208.37
  * Stock Lending &rarr; $2.99
  * Interest &rarr; $2.29
* Capital One CD &rarr; $41.33
* Treasury Direct &rarr; $18.38
* [Arrived Homes](https://arrivedhomes.com/) &rarr; $16.10
* [Worthy Bonds](https://www.joehxblog.com/worthybonds/) &rarr; $8.36
* [WeBull Dividends](https://www.joehxblog.com/webull/) &rarr; $2.71
* Total &rarr; $3,122.44

*Interest-Bearing* means anything that I may receive a 1099-INT or 1099-DIV for. In other words - bank account interest and dividends.

My credit union pays 7% on the first $1,000 in its savings account. Both my wife and I have accounts there, netting use 7% on %2,000, or around $140 a year. The remaining amount is from a couple of CDs we have with them.

Treasury Direct does not include things like I-Bonds - only the amount that (I think) will appear on the 1099s I'll receive later.

## Print-On-Demand Sites

* [Merch by Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=%22joehx%22&i=fashion&tag=hendrixjoseph-20) &rarr; $1,002.44
* [TeePublic](https://www.joehxblog.com/teepublic/) &rarr; $46.50
* Redbubble &rarr; $44.24

  * Rewards &rarr; $3.56
  * Staking &rarr; $10.76
  * Capital Loses -$671.24
* Total &rarr; -$656.92

The "capital losses" are from when I moved a bunch of coins I didn't want into bitcoin.

This year I'm also not counting my BlockFi account. I was hoping the bankruptcy proceedings would be finished by now and that I'd be able to claim the losses on my taxes. Maybe next year.
