I've been writing on this iteration of my blog since 2015. That's over five years - and one of the staples of this blog has been, since the second year, the end-of-year side income report.

And this post is the *sixth* end-of-year side income report. Here's the previous five:

* [2020 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2020-end-of-year-side-income-report/)
* [2019 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2019-end-of-year-side-income-report/)
* [2018 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2018-end-of-year-side-income-report/)
* [2017 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2017-end-of-year-side-income-report/)
* [2016 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2016-end-of-year-side-income-report/)

## Credit Card Rewards

* [Chase Freedom Unlimited](https://www.joehxblog.com/chase-freedom-unlimited/) &rarr; $139.16
* [Chase Freedom Flex](https://www.joehxblog.com/chase-freedom/) &rarr; $701.07
* Chase Freedom &rarr; $304.04
* US Bank Cash+ &rarr; $70.40
* [Capital One Quicksilver](https://www.joehxblog.com/capital-one/) &rarr; $63.14
* Citi Double Cash &arr; $429.55
* Total &rarr; $1,707.36

The [Chase Freedom Flex](https://www.joehxblog.com/chase-freedom/)  was clearly my money-maker this year, netting me just over seven hundred dollars. That's because the signup bonus was earning 5% on groceries for the first year (up to a certain amount - which I didn't reach).

My Citi Double Cash card came in second place earning over four hundred dollars. That's my go-to card when another card doesn't earn something special. The Double Cash, as you're probably aware, "effectively" earns 2% cash back on everything.

## Interest-Bearing Accounts

* [Robinhood](https://www.joehxblog.com/robinhood/) &rarr; $46.65
* [WeBull](https://www.joehxblog.com/webull/) &rarr; $2.19
* [Worthy Bonds](https://www.joehxblog.com/worthybonds/) &rarr; $3.64
* Credit Union Interest &rarr; $86.76
* Ally Interest &rarr; $123.94
* Total &rarr; $263.18

*Interest-Bearing* means anything that I may receive a 1099-INT or 1099-DIV for. Otherwards - bank account interest and dividends.

My local credit union has been paying [6% interest](https://www.joehxblog.com/wright-patt-credit-union-quietly-doubles-truesaver-rate/) on amounts up to $500 for almost three years now. Since my wife and I both have accounts, we're getting that 6% interest on $1,000 - meaning we earn at least sixty dollars together. Coupled with other incentives, that pushed us to the eighty-six we did earn.

The Ally "high-interest" account has dropped down to half a percent. Not quite so "high interest" anymore.

[Worthy Bonds](https://www.joehxblog.com/worthybonds/) does pay a decent 5%, but they're "junk bonds" (although they are secured) and there's not an unlimited supply of them. Right now, I can't buy any more even if I wanted to.



## Print-On-Demand Sites

* [Merch by Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=%22joehx%22&i=fashion&tag=hendrixjoseph-20) &rarr; $1,492.16
* [Kindle Direct Publishing](https://www.amazon.com/Joseph-Hendrix/e/B081HH6SRL/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) &rarr; $0.00
* [Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com/people/joehx) &rarr; $86.03
* [TeePublic](https://www.joehxblog.com/teepublic/) &rarr; $107.25
* Total &rarr; $1,685.44

[Merch by Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=%22joehx%22&i=fashion&tag=hendrixjoseph-20) is my money maker here earning almost fifteen hundred bucks. Combined with my [Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com/people/joehx) and [TeePublic](https://www.joehxblog.com/teepublic/) I've made almost seventeen hundred bucks.

I have three books published on Amazon - [The Adventures of Princess](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SRJTTMW/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20), [The Adventures of Niko](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07M68STB4/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20), and [100 Sudoku Puzzles](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1707062951/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). Nobody ever buys them though, so that's why my Kindle Direct Publishing amount is zero.

## Blogging

* Amazon Associates &rarr; $734.41
* Google AdSense &rarr; $1030.90
* [WeBull](https://www.joehxblog.com/webull/) Bonuses & Referrals &rarr; $84.43
* [Robinhood](https://www.joehxblog.com/robinhood/) Referrals &rarr; $38.67
* Total &rarr; $1,888.41

My blog is finally making some money.

My Amazon Associates account is still making decent money thanks to this [Dorco post](https://www.joehxblog.com/how-to-get-dorco-razor-blades-after-dorcousa-shuts-down/) I made over two years ago.

Google AdSense is making not quite $100 a month. $100 is the payout threshold, so I've received a payout almost every month this year.

The [WeBull](https://www.joehxblog.com/webull/) and [Robinhood](https://www.joehxblog.com/robinhood/) bonuses are paid in stock - so the value might be different now than when it was earned.

## Cryptocurrency Earnings

* [BlockFi](https://www.joehxblog.com/blockfi/) &rarr; $89.27*
* [Coinbase](https://www.joehxblog.com/coinbase/) &rarr; $109.73*
* Total &rarr; $199.00

My [BlockFi](https://www.joehxblog.com/blockfi/) earnings is pure interest. It's paid in the cryptocurrency I've invested in - I've only converted it to dollar amounts here to make comparisons easier.

[Coinbase](https://www.joehxblog.com/coinbase/), howerever, is split between three types of earnings: Coinbase Earn, where I earn by taking courses on Coinbase, Coinbase Interest, where I earn by staking certain coins, and Coinbase Referrals, where I earn when someone signs up to Coinbase using my referral link. Breaking them down, the three types earned each:

* Coinbase Earn &rarr; $60.58
* Coinbase Interest &rarr; $9.12
* Coinbase Referrals &rarr; $40.03

## Miscellaneous

* Clinical Study &rarr; $890
* GM Settlement &rarr; $97.43
* Chipotle Settlement &rarr; $4.00
* Valvoline Rebate &rarr; $10.00
* Michelin Rebate &rarr; $70.00
* [Receipt Hog](https://www.joehxblog.com/receipt-hog/) &rarr; $40.00
* [Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/) &rarr; $5.01
* Total &rarr; $1,116.44

Here is a clinical study my daughter is in, two class-action lawsuits, two rebates, a receipt tracking app, and a couple surveys I did.
