Welcome to my blog! Bear with us here, were just now getting the site set up, getting the kinks and the bugs out of the system.

:D So what will I talk about here? I’m glad you asked! Anything, really. Stuff that goes on in life, weird thoughts I might have (which actually happens a lot), and how the company is doing.

What company? Hendrices Entertainment of course! What kind of entertainment? Whatever we feel like. There’s not much yet as we have just started. Essentially Hendrices Entertainment is just a portfolio site for my brother and I, thus it will contain quite a variety of stuff.

Until next time

Joe
