The year is half over and  the official first day of summer is tomorrow. Meaning today is the twentieth and it's time for another blog stat report.

I made three posts in the past month:

* [Solving the Assignment in the OWASP WebGoat Crypto Basics Signature Lesson](https://www.joehxblog.com/owasp-webgoat-crypto-basics-signature-lesson/)
* [May 2022 Book Reading List](https://www.joehxblog.com/may-2022-book-reading-list/)
* [Lazily Check the Body of an HttpServletResponse](https://www.joehxblog.com/lazily-check-the-body-of-an-httpservletresponse/)

## Alexa

As I've been saying on my past reports, Alexa is no more. Just try to go to [my Alexa site info page](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/joehxblog.com).

But the Alexa browser extension on Firefox continues to give Alexa rankings... For now.
