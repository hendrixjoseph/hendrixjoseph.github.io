title: Interesting Reads for the Week Ending August 13th
tags: [interesting reads]
---

Happy Friday the 13th everybody! Here's what I read that I found interesting over the past week.

## The Rules

Here are the rules for what articles I choose to include in this weekly roundup:

1. It can't be anything I wrote.
2. It has to be something I actually read. Nothing that simply had an interesting headline.
3. I have to have read it since the previous post. It does not have to be something that was written in the past week.
4. It has to be something I read online. In other words, it has to be a webpage with a URL.

## The Reads

I'm subscribed to the Windows Insider Program, which means I'm running a preview build of Windows 11. It's okay, but I've got my complaints:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh cool, I got the new Windows taskbar and start menu. Except now my carefully crafted pinned start menu is now gone...<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/progress?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#progress</a> <a href="https://t.co/OvetCGiTZp">pic.twitter.com/OvetCGiTZp</a></p>&mdash; Joseph Hendrix (@JoeHxBlog) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeHxBlog/status/1412149836309225472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 5, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Plus my desktop doesn't meet the minimum hardware requirements at the moment:

![Windows 11 Insider Minimum Hardware Requirements Not Met Warning](/images/windows-11-minimum-hardware-warning.png)

In either case, it was interesting to read the [Windows 11 build 22000.120 (and earlier) report](https://www.windowscentral.com/windows-11-build-22000120-earlier-everything-you-need-know) to get an overview of what is going on.

How do you pronounce URL? Do you say the letters: you-are-elle? Or do you say it like the name *earl*? That's the topic of the StackExchange post [How should URL be pronounced?](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/217712/how-should-url-be-pronounced)

Here's an interesting look into the [day in the life of a cybersecurity "threat hunter"](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/behind-the-scenes-a-day-in-the-life-of-a-cybersecurity-threat-hunter/).

There are many articles on what you can do for a side hustle. Here's an article on the flip side: [4 Side Hustles That Aren't Worth the Work](https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/personal-finance/articles/4-side-hustles-that-arent-worth-the-work/). (Spoiler: they're becoming part of an MLM, opening an online store, survey sites, and mystery shopping.)

I've made a few games for Android (ok, two games: [Tic Tac Toe](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joehxblog.tictactoe) and [Moonshot](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joehxblox.moonshot)). That's why I was interested in this Google Blog post on [Introducing the Android Game Development Kit](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/07/introducing-android-game-development-kit.html).

Finally, this article on [better ways to convince people to get vaccinated](https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/05/opinions/how-to-move-people-from-hesitant-to-vaccinated-bregman-jacobson/index.html): use empathy, not shame and ridicule.
