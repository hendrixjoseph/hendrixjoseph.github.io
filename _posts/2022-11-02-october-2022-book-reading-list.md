## The Books I Read for Me

The first book I read was a nonfiction book - [Hacking Healthcare: A Guide to Standards, Workflows, and Meaningful Use by Fred Trotter and David Uhlman](https://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Healthcare-Standards-Workflows-Meaningful/dp/1449305024/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). Except the copy I bought had a different cover - and it's title was *Meaningful Use*. At first I thought I had received the wrong book, but after comparing the insides with the preview on Amazon, it was the same book.

The second book was fiction - it was the sequel to [Ernest Cline's Ready Player One](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004J4WKUQ/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) conveniently titled [Ready Player Two](https://www.amazon.com/Ready-Player-Two-Novel-Book-ebook/dp/B08BYWH6CS/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). Did it capture the "magic" of the first one? I don't know. It was similar - but different enough - to the first one to be just as enjoyable.
