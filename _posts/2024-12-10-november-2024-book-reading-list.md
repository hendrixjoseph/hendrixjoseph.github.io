I thought I was late posting my monthly book reading list... But it turns out, I posted it on the *eleventh* last month.

So I'm a day early compared to last month.

I read six different books to my son and nine different books to my daughter.

I didn't manage to finish any books for me. I *am* reading a book, but it's a technical book and a bit dense, so it's taking awhile.

## Books I Read to My Children

### The Book I Read to My Son

* Anywhere Artist
* Danny and the Dinosaur Mind Their Manners
* Diary of a Worm Teacher's Pet
* The Berenstain Bears' Thanksgiving
* The Cool Bean
* There was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Turkey!

### Books I Read to My Daughter

* Attack of the Underwear Dragon
* Be Thankful, Pout-Pout Fish
* Danny and the Dinosaur Mind Their Manners
* Hamsters Make Terrible Roommates
* Not All Princesses Wear Pink
* Splat Says Thank You!
* The Bad Seed Goes to the Library
* The Berenstain Bears All Aboard!
