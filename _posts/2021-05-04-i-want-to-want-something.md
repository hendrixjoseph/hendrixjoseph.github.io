Having is not so pleasing a thing as wanting.

Or goes Spock in [Amok Time](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0708416/characters/nm0000559).

The other day I was browsing the aisles at the local Lowe's. I already had in my hand what I came for - a few [steel sign holders](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Hillman-18-in-Steel-H-Bracket/3295380) for some yard signs for [my campaign](https://www.joe4huberheights.com/) - but I wanted something else. I wasn't sure what it was.

I don't really want anything. I pretty much have what I want. I have an awesome wife and two awesome kids. I mean, we have our good moments and not-so-good moments, but for the most part, I'm happy with what I have.

Our two vehicles - our [2014 Honda Odyssey](https://www.joehxblog.com/we-bought-a-van/) and our [2016 Honda Accord](https://www.joehxblog.com/we-bought-a-car/) - are fully paid off. And, for me, I don't want a shiny new car. For me, seeing how long I can keep a car and how many miles I can put on it before it falls apart is the thing. My last vehicle - a 2007 Chevy Cobalt I bought brand new - lasted me ten years.

We have some work we want to be done to our home - namely, a shut put in and the driveway repaved - so, I guess that could be something we want. But as I drifted from aisle to aisle at Lowe's searching for *something* - something fun, I guess - I thought of the phrase at the beginning of this post.

The phrase, yes, comes from Amok Time, the classic Star Trek episode. But in my mind, it comes from a poster I had in my room as a teenager back in the late 90s and early 2000s. The poster was, as you might imagine, a Star Trek poster. It had several dozen Star Trek quotes.

But I digress. The real point of this post is that I feel content. But despite that contentness, there's a desire to go through the journey of how I got where I am again.

I've done a few Google searches such as [things to make life easier](https://www.google.com/search?q=things+to+make+life+easier) but, as one might expect, it just brings up a list of Amazon affiliate sites trying to shill products. None of which will actually make life easier.

I think, for now, I'll just enjoy my family.
