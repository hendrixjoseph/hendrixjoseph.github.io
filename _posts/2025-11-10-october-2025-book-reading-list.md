It must be the end of an era. For the first time in over seven years, I read no books to either my son or my daughter.

My son, being seven years old and in second grade, can read - and loves to read - to himself now. My daughter, who's about to turn six and is in kindergarten, is starting to read on her own.

But despite not reading to either kids, I did read to myself. And, coincidentally, both books I read happened to be parenting books:

* [The Opposite of Spoiled by Ron Lieber](https://www.amazon.com/Opposite-Spoiled-Raising-Grounded-Generous-ebook/dp/B00KAC65PW/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20)
* [Good Inside by Dr. Becky Kennedy](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Inside-Guide-Becoming-Parent-ebook/dp/B09KPS84CJ/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20)

The first book was a money book (which I should have guessed by it's subtitle *Raising Kids Who Are Grounded, Generous, and Smart About Money*). Being a parenting book in addition to being a money book, I felt it was sufficiently different from other personal finance books that tend to repeat each other.

As far as parenting books go, *Good Inside* is one of the better ones. I will say that the author tended to assume that the person reading the book is the mother, although she does try to be inclusive of fathers reading as well. To be fair, most parenting books that try to relate to fathers over-do it on sports-and-beer metaphors, which is more annoying than parenting books that assume the reader is a mother.
