Over the weekend I attended the [2021 Libertarian Party of Ohio Conference](https://lpo.org/event/2021-libertarian-party-of-ohio-conference/). At the end of the conference, the five speakers - Evan McMahon, Spike Cohen, Ken Moellman, Mayor Cassandra Fryman, and Jim Cavoli - hosted a panel in which the audience could ask them any question.

One question was *What book would you recommend?* In this post, I will share their answers and provide links where you can go buy the recommended books.

## Evan McMahon

Evan McMahon is the Chair of the Libertarian Party of Indiana. He has also served as former Executive Director of the Libertarian National Campaign Committee (LNCC), former At-Large Rep on the Libertarian National Committee (LNC), and campaign manager or advisor for several high profile campaigns.

Evan recommended *Rules for Radicals: A Pragmatic Primer for Realistic Radicals* by Saul Alinsky and *Winning Your Election the Wellstone Way*.

## Spike Cohen

Spike Cohen was the Vice Presidential candidate for the Libertarian Party back in 2020. He is also the co-owner of [Muddied Waters Media](http://muddiedwatersmedia.com/), the co-host of The Muddied Waters of Freedom, and the host of My Fellow Americans.

Spike recommended *How to Win Friends and Influence People* by Dale Carnegie.

I read this book back in [April of this year](https://www.joehxblog.com/april-2021-book-reading-list/#the-books-i-read-for-me), and I agree it is an excellent book. Similar books are full of lots of fluff with no substance. This one definitely has substance.

## Ken Moellman

Ken is the Vice Chair of the Libertarian National Committee and Northern Kentucky resident.

He didn't have any specific books he recommended. Instead, he recommended that people get books about things they're weakest at. For instance, he has about seven or eight books on fundraising.
