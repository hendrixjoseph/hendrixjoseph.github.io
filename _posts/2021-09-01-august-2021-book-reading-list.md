Quite a month. I read fifty-four different books to my son, thirteen different books to my daughter, and two books for myself.

## Books I Read to My Children

### Books I Read to My Son

It helps that my son loves to be read to. Who can resist a three-year-old bringing you a book and asking "Can you read this book to me?"

And although he's not literate yet, he likes to read. Or at least pretend to read.

Here's the 54 different books I read to him last month:

### Books I Read to My Daughter

My daughter likes dinosaurs, dogs, and Elmo. And she likes being read to, as well, but probably not as much as my son.

It probably doesn't help that he can't stand someone reading to her without him looking at the book, too.

Here are the 13 different books I read to my daughter last month:

* [A Perfect Picnic](https://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/2462910/77416/2029?u=https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9781403710444/30742065171)

## The Books I Read for Me

I read two books - both nonfiction.

The first book I read for work - [Oracle Database 12c PL/SQL Programming by Michael McLaughlin](
https://www.amazon.com/dp/0071812431/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20).

The second was [The 4-Hour Workweek](
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002WE46UW/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). It wasn't... as bad as I expected. It did have some decent concepts out there. The first half was more abstract, whereas the second half was very detailed oriented. And the second half was horribly out of date.

If you really want to get an idea of how good or bad this book is, be sure to check out [its reviews on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002WE46UW/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20#customerReviews).
