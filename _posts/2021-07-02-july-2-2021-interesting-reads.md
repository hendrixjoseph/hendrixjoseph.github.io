title: Interesting Reads for the Week Ending July 2nd
tags: [interesting reads]
---

Week five of *interesting reads* in the sixth week. I missed last week due to being on vacation.

## The Rules

Here are the rules for what articles I choose to include in this weekly roundup:

1. It can't be anything I wrote.
2. It has to be something I actually read. Nothing that simply had an interesting headline.
3. I have to have read it since the previous post. It does not have to be something that was written in the past week.
4. It has to be something I read online. In other words, it has to be a webpage with a URL.

## The Reads

It seems now that [To Fly a Drone in the U.S., You Now Must Pass FAA's TRUST Test](https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/drones/all-recreational-drone-pilots-must-now-past-the-faas-trust-test). I think the title doesn't emphasize the fact that this is for flying recreationally. For fun. I think you already needed one to fly for business.

The FAA doesn't administer the test themselves, however. They do have a [list of approved test administrators](https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_fliers/knowledge_test_updates/). Even though I don't even own a drone, I went ahead and took [the TRUST test at the Boy Scout's website](https://www.scouting.org/the-recreational-uas-safety-test/).

For the last few months (April 12th through June 1st to be exact), Mint held a contest where you could [win $10,000](https://mint.intuit.com/blog/updates/mint-10k-giveaway-earn-a-chance-to-get-your-expenses-covered/). This month - July 1st through the 31st - [Mint is doing another contest](https://mint.intuit.com/blog/updates/mint-50k-giveaway-our-biggest-one-yet/) with 10 weekly winners who will win $500 or $1,000. At the end of the month, there will be a grand prize of $50,000.

I didn't win last time. I probably won't win again. But the effort to log into Mint each day is minimal, so I might as well.

I haven't played with it yet, but [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/) looks interesting. It's like autocomplete with AI.

People were surprised when [A Man Flew Through Times Square on a Colossal Drone](https://interestingengineering.com/man-flew-through-times-square-on-colossal-drone-nyc).

The [original Tweet with the video](https://twitter.com/WUTangKids/status/1406990721861754882) seems to be gone, but one of the replies also had a video:

Since I only have a few years left until I hit that age, I had to read [Challenging the Myth That Programming Careers End at 40](https://thenewstack.io/challenging-the-myth-that-programming-careers-end-at-40/). Fortunately, there are people in their sixties who are still working on their craft.

This sounded exhausting - the author [Tried to Network With 30 People in 30 Days](https://www.themuse.com/advice/i-tried-30-day-networking-challenge). Networking - the people kind - is one of my biggest challenges, and it doesn't help that I'm an introvert. In fact, networking is my go-to "greatest weakness" in job interviews.

This article resonated with me: [Bad coding practices. 5 horrific techniques that will make your co-developers really hate your code](https://tsh.io/blog/bad-coding-practices/). So many times I come across a variable that either doesn't describe what it does or is abbreviated beyond all recognition. C'mon, people, you're not saving anything by cutting out a few letters in that there variable name! Plus - copy and pasted code is not using the same code.

I mentioned a few weeks about how I have an [exercise routine](https://www.joehxblog.com/my-exercise-routine/). I figured I needed to add stretches to my routine, so I found this [beginner's guide to mobility & stretching](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/fitness/a755395/the-beginners-guide-to-mobility-stretching/). That guide from Men's Health has six not-too-difficult stretches, along with animated gifs showing how the stretches are done.
