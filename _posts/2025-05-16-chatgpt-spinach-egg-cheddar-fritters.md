title: ChatGPT Spinach, Egg, & Cheddar Fritters

I seem to be building a series on these ChatGPT-generated recipes. This one - spinach, egg, and cheddar fritters - I made on Mother's Day morning. My wife enjoyed them. I enjoyed them. My kids - who are 5 and 7 - wouldn't even try them.

Why did I decide to make spinach, egg, and cheddar fritters? We had some extra frozen spinach that wasn't being used. Plus I think I misunderstood what a fritter is - I *thought* I saw some egg-based dish called a fritter at a continental breakfast we had at a hotel recently, but maybe it was something else.

In any case, here's the recipe. Enjoy!

## Spinach & Cheddar Fritters

### Ingredients

* 1 cup frozen spinach (thawed & well-drained)
* 4 eggs
* 1/2 to 3/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese
* 1/4 cup flour
* Salt & pepper to taste
* Oil or butter for frying
* Optional Add-ins:
  * Garlic powder or onion powder
  * Chopped onion or scallions
  * A dash of baking powder for fluffiness, or if you only have baking soda, use just a pinch (1/8 tsp) and add a small splash (1/2 tsp) of lemon juice or vinegar to activate it

### Instructions

Prep spinach: Make sure the spinach is thawed and squeezed dry.

Mix: In a bowl, combine eggs, spinach, cheese, and flour/breadcrumbs. Add salt, pepper, and any spices.

Form fritters: Scoop out a heaping spoonful of the mixture and gently flatten into a patty.

Cook: Heat a skillet over medium heat with a little oil. Fry each fritter for about 2â€“3 minutes per side until golden and cooked through.

Serve: Eat warm, plain or with sour cream, hot sauce, or yogurt.
