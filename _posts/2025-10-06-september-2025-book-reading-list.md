My, oh, my, if it isn't a new month. That means it's time to report on what I read last month.

In September, I read five books to my daughter:

* Listen to My Trumpet!
* Put Me in the Zoo
* Sleep Tight, Disgusting Blob
* Spring Stinks
* What If Everybody Thought That?

I didn't read any books to my son. That said, I did read the first two books from the *Dragon Masters* series by Tracey West that he is reading (or read, as he's already finished pretty much the entire series!): [Rise of the Earth Dragon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JEIDX4O/?tag=hendrix) and [Saving the Sun Dragon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KC07KSI/?tag=hendrix).

And I did read some books aimed at grown-ups: [The Future](https://www.amazon.com/p/B0BX7CK5VG/?tag=hendrix) by Naomi Alderman, [Source Code: My Beginnings](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3LN2Z9K/?tag=hendrix) by Bill Gates (a.k.a. his autobiography that covers his life up to the start of Microsoft), and [Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Book One: The Lightning Thief](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00280LYIC/?tag=hendrix) by Rick Riordan.

Ok, *Percy Jackson* is a bit more young-adult than grown-up (young-grown-up?) but still much more mature than the books my son has been reading. After all, he's only seven!
