Prime Day just happened, so I wanted to grab the [Chase Amazon Prime Visa](https://www.joehxblog.com/prime-visa/) while the bonus was higher than normal.

I had some questions about the card before I applied, however. I wasn't able to answer them *before*, but I did figure out the answers *after*. In order to help anyone else in the future, I've asked & answered them here.

Feel free to ask more questions in the comments below.

## Does the Chase Amazon Prime Visa show up in my Chase Login?

Yes, it's right there with my [Chase Freedom Flex](https://www.joehxblog.com/chase-freedom-flex/), [Chase Freedom Unlimited](https://www.joehxblog.com/chase-freedom-unlimited/), and [OG Chase Freedom](https://www.joehxblog.com/chase-freedom/).

You can also link it to your Amazon account and pay it on the Amazon site. I find it easier to manage alongside my other Chase cards, though.

## Does the Chase Amazon Prime Visa have Chase Offers?

Yes. It took a few days for it to show up on Chase Offers, however.

## Can my wife add my Chase Amazon Prime Visa to her Amazon account?

Yes.

While she does have a separate Amazon account, we do share Amazon Prime benefits via [Amazon Family](https://www.amazon.com/hz/profilepicker/amazonfamily/sharing/SHOPPING?tag=hendrixjoseph-20).

Also, I don't know if this matters as far as adding the card to her account, but I did add her as an authorized user.

## Do I get 5% back on her purchases?

Yes. In fact, I earned 1,444 points (worth $14.44) on $288.97 she spent on Prime Day (she stocked up on some essentials):

## Can I get the cash back as a direct deposit?

Yes, and it works almost the same as my other Chase cards.

I say *almost* because it works even better - I didn't have to wait until my statement posted in order to have the cash back deposited into [my savings account](https://www.joehxblog.com/ally/) - I was able to claim the cash back as soon as the transaction posted!

## How Quick Did the Bonus Amazon Gift Card Load?

Instantaneous. If there was any delay, the delay from getting approved to me loading [the page to see my Amazon gift card balance](https://www.amazon.com/gp/css/gc/balance?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) took longer.
