September was a slower month for reading compared to August.

I read twenty-seven books to my son (compared to August's fifty-four!) and ten books to my daughter (compared to August's thirteen).

And I read two books for myself.

## The Books I Read for Me

I finished the fifth Harry Potter book - 
[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0192CTMXM/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). Two more to go.

I also read [Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004J4WNL2/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). I'm definitely an introvert; this book helped me understand myself better.
