Well, well, well. It's eleven days into August, and I'm just now getting to my monthly book reading post.

This month the post is short. I didn't read any books to my son (he most definitely read books for himself, though!) and only read three books to my daughter: Spring Stinks, I'm Bored, and The Bears' Vacation.

I read [The Ministry of Time](https://www.amazon.com/Ministry-Time-Novel-Kaliane-Bradley-ebook/dp/B0CL5FT5C3/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). A bit more romance than I expected - not that there's anything wrong with that. Also an entirely enjoyable book.
