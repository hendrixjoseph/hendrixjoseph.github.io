title: Interesting Reads for the Week Ending July 16th
tags: [interesting reads]
---

Number seven. That's the number of interesting reads posts I've now made, including this one.

These interesting reads posts are a collection of stories I read on the internet over the past week.

## The Rules

Here are the rules for what articles I choose to include in this weekly roundup:

1. It can't be anything I wrote.
2. It has to be something I actually read. Nothing that simply had an interesting headline.
3. I have to have read it since the previous post. It does not have to be something that was written in the past week.
4. It has to be something I read online. In other words, it has to be a webpage with a URL.

## The Reads

It seems there's [an increase in “Chain Gang” Destructive Attacks on ATMs](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/07/spike-in-chain-gang-destructive-attacks-on-atms/). And, interestingly enough, stealing an ATM is a lesser charge than outright robbing a bank - even though stealing an ATM is much more profitable than robbing a bank.

Someone named [Kevin was having trouble contacting Verizon customer support](https://www.zdnet.com/article/verizon-wasnt-responding-so-an-angry-customer-found-a-brilliant-solution/) - so he called Verizon collections instead and got an immediate response.

[Netflix is looking to add video games to their service](https://www.thedad.com/netflix-video-game/). I'm not sure how that will work. Will they have a [GameFly](https://www.gamefly.com/)-like component? Entirely digital? Or will this be the last I hear of it?

I've never used Twitter Fleets. And it seems that I'm not alone. [Twitter is shutting down Fleets on August 3, citing low usage](https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/twitter-is-shutting-down-fleets-on-august-3-citing-low-usage/). Fun fact: I also don't use Facebook stories or even have an account the original ephemeral service Snapchat.

This sucks. [A Large Chunk Of Amazon Rainforest Now Emits More Carbon Than It Takes In, Study Finds](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicholasreimann/2021/07/14/large-chunk-of-amazon-rainforest-now-emits-more-carbon-than-it-takes-in-study-finds/?sh=76836452acb0). Although that "large chunk" is no longer rainforest - it's parts that have been torn down to make way for things such as farming.

90% of success is just showing up. That's the gist of the article [The unreasonable effectiveness of just showing up everyday](https://typesense.org/blog/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-just-showing-up-everyday/).
