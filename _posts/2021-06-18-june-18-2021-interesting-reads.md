title: Interesting Reads for the Week Ending June 18th
tags: [interesting reads]
---

Oh, hey, it's the fourth week of my new interesting reads series.

I'm going to miss next week, though. Week five will be on the sixth week.

## The Rules

Here are the rules for what articles I choose to include in this weekly roundup:

1. It can't be anything I wrote.
2. It has to be something I actually read. Nothing that simply had an interesting headline.
3. I have to have read it since the previous post. It does not have to be something that was written in the past week.
4. It has to be something I read online. In other words, it has to be a webpage with a URL.

## The Reads

Another benefit of increased remote work... Even just [A Little More Remote Work Could Change Rush Hour a Lot](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/11/upshot/rush-hour-remote-work.html).

Completely different from the 5-second rule, [Emotionally Intelligent People Embrace the 5-Minute Rule](https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/emotionally-intelligent-people-embrace-5-minute-rule.html). Basically, if you have a task you're procrastinating on, commit to doing that task for five minutes. If after five minutes you want to stop, then stop. Chances are you'll want to keep going.

A [Husband of Amazon employee sentenced to prison for insider trading in Amazon stock](https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/pr/husband-amazon-employee-sentenced-prison-insider-trading-amazon-stock). Dude made more than $1.4 million trading in advance of 11 straight earnings announcements. He did end up paying $2,652,899, so that's about a $1.2 million loss. Unsure if he's facing any time, but the prosecutors were asking for a 33-month sentence.

Square Enix is releasing the first six Final Fantasy games as [Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster](https://screenrant.com/final-fantasy-pixel-remaster-first-six-games/). They're currently slated to be released individually on Stream and Mobile (I'm assuming "mobile" is both on Google Play and the Apple App Store).

I have many fond memories of playing the Final Fantasy series growing up, particularly Final Fantasy III (aka Final Fantasy VI).

If you looking for a job, you might ask yourself [How Does One Get Hired by a Top Cybercrime Gang?](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/06/how-does-one-get-hired-by-a-top-cybercrime-gang/) Or not. This post by Brian Krebs tells about the indictment and arrest of a 55-year-old Latvian woman programmer. She's not your typical hacker.
