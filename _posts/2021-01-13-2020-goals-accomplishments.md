It's a brand new year, which means it's time to set yearly goals. But before I list my goals for 2021, let's take a look at how I did for [my 2020 goals](https://www.joehxblog.com/2020-new-years-resolutions-goals/). 

## Improve Our Finances

* Max out our Roth IRAs
* Max our 401k match
* Max out our HSA
* Put $25 a month per kid (so $50 total per month) into their 529 accounts
* Lower our debt by at least $20k
* Eat out at most once a week
* Publish more "low content" books such as my [Soduku Puzzle Book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1707062951?tag=hendrixjoseph-20)

We did most of these. Putting the max in our Roth IRAs and HSA was simple since it was done via payroll deductions and direct deposit. Same for maxing our 401k match. Although I did have to transfer a little over $100 into my HSA since, for whatever reason, my final paycheck for 2020 didn't have any HSA money deducted (I suspect it was because my normal amount would have put me over the HSA limit).

Putting $25 a month per kid into their 529 accounts was automatic, too, but not via payroll deductions but rather auto-debits from my wife's checking account.

We had also paid off around $20,000 in debt by halfway through the year.

We did okay eating out at most once a week. There have been a couple of caveats. Since we've both been working from home during the [coronavirus pandemic](https://www.joehxblog.com/how-im-preparing-for-the-looming-recession-and-the-coronavirus-pandemic/), I've been going to get takeout once a week for lunch. We've also been ordering takeout typically once a weekend. Plus, we also didn't do too well towards the end of the year.

Finally, I didn't even start on another low-content book, let alone publish one.

## Improve Our Home

I installed a french drain last year (and never wrote about it! how dare I!). I also planted a lot of grass.

I really wish I took pictures of the process.

The goal we didn't make was planning on what to do about the driveway. We did put some mulch down in one of the ruts - which, surprisingly, made it look much better.

## Improve Our Health

* Weigh less than 225 lbs
* Track my cholesterol and blood pressure
* Keep my habit of taking the stairs at work

I did get awfully close to [my weight fitness goal for 2020](https://www.joehxblog.com/meeting-my-fitness-goal-in-2020/) - less than a pound over my goal.

However, I wasn't able to track my cholesterol because any of the free cholesterol checking clinics were closed due to the pandemic. And I can't take the stairs at work when I'm working from home.

I checked my blood pressure a grand total of one time - on November 11th. It was 120/75. The [normal range for blood pressure](https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/about.htm) is 120/80 (or less), so I'm good. (This is in mmHg units.)

## Develop Personally & Professionally

* Attend Conferences & Other Networking Events
* Publish an Android app

Despite it being a pandemic, I was able to attend a couple of conferences. I attended the online portion of the [2020 Libertarian Convention](https://lnc2020.com/), as well as the in-person, social-distanced [Libertarian Party of Ohio 2020 State Convention](https://lpo.org/event/libertarian-party-of-ohio-2020-state-convention/).

The [2020 District 40 “D40” Toastmaster Conference](https://www.d40toastmastersconference.org/) was canceled and Kroger’s annual shareholder meeting was not held in-person.

Data Connectors 2020 Cincinnati Cybersecurity Conference was held virtually, and I did attend that.

Finally, I published not one, but three Android apps: [Moonshot](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joehxblox.moonshot),    [Tagger](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joehxblog.tictactoe), and [Tic Tac Toe](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joehxblog.tictactoe).

*Moonshot* was my [GitHub Game Off 2020 entry](https://www.joehxblog.com/my-github-game-off-2020-entry/). *Tic Tac Toe* is, well, tic tac toe. And *Tagger* allows users to share and tag Amazon products directly from the Amazon App, web browser, or any other app that allows you to share Amazon products.

## Get Involved with the Community

* Volunteer at church at least once
* Apply for a local board and commission position

We weren't able to volunteer - again due to the coronavirus.

However, I did apply to a commission - and got selected! That commission is the [Ordinance Review Commission](https://www.hhoh.org/291/Ordinance-Review-Commission).

## Better Our Marriage

* At least seven date nights
* Attend at least one marriage seminar or retreat

The trend of not being able to do things because of the coronavirus continues. We did not attend any marriage seminar or retreat.

We were able to go on a few dates, however. My wife started writing down the dates of our dates (puns always intended) and she was able to list six dates.
