I don't have too much time today, so I'm going to be quick with this month's book reading list. I will say that this is the end of my third year posting these [monthly book reading lists](https://www.joehxblog.com/tags/#reading-list).

My first was in [January 2018](https://www.joehxblog.com/january-2018-book-reading-list/), and I've only missed February 2018 so far.

## The Book I Read for Me

In finished book three of [the Cluster Series by Piers Anthony](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07G2235FK/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). Book three is called "Kirlian Quest."

I've said it in the last two book reading tests: I borrowed the series for free via [free Prime Reading](https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/fd/prime-pr?tag=hendrixjoseph-20).

I'm continuing to read [the textbook on local government](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0495802654/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) I bought. I finished chapter 11 last night. I aim to read a chapter a night - since there are 18 total chapters, I should finish the book in seven days - one week.
