20. 20th. Twenty. Twentieth. It's the twentieth, which means it's time to report my blog statistics.

I made three posts in the past month:

* [Questions on Branches and Rebases in Git](https://www.joehxblog.com/questions-on-branches-and-rebases-in-git/)
* [June 2022 Book Reading List](https://www.joehxblog.com/june-2022-book-reading-list/)
* [My New Water Softener](https://www.joehxblog.com/my-new-water-softener/)

## Alexa

As I've been saying on my past reports, Alexa is no more. Just try to go to [my Alexa site info page](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/joehxblog.com).

But the Alexa browser extension on Firefox continues to give Alexa rankings... For now.
