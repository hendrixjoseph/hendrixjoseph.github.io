title: Interesting Reads for the Week Ending September 10th
tags: [interesting reads]
---

Here's what I read that I found interesting over the past week.

## The Rules

Here are the rules for what articles I choose to include in this weekly roundup:

1. It can't be anything I wrote.
2. It has to be something I actually read. Nothing that simply had an interesting headline.
3. I have to have read it since the previous post. It does not have to be something that was written in the past week.
4. It has to be something I read online. In other words, it has to be a webpage with a URL.

## The Reads

If you've seen the pics, you'll know why this was needed. [iRobotâ€™s newest Roomba uses AI to avoid dog poop](https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22660467/irobot-roomba-ai-dog-poop-avoidance-j7-specs-price). Finally, a good use for AI.

This is going to make some fans mad - and some fans angry. [Strange New Worlds Shockingly Reboots 3 Classic Star Trek Characters](
https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/strange-new-worlds-shockingly-reboots-3-classic-star-trek-characters/). Spoiler alert: those three characters are:

Cyber security, including pen tests, is an interest of mine. I'm also learning Irish on Duolingo. That's why Duolingo's blog post [Why did we deliberately hack the Duolingo English Test?](https://blog.duolingo.com/duolingo-english-test-security/) interested me.

Finally, check out [this Matrix trailer which dynamically uses current time](https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/). How it works is a little... anticlimatic. There are different videos for each minute of the day (there are 60*24=1,440 minutes in a day). Read [this HackerNews post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28446761) for more info and [this GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com/gregsadetsky/cb4754d123f0ea1eae26820d5aefdde1) for a list of the video URLs.

And here's the YouTube trailer:
