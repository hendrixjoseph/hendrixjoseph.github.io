August is over and September is here.

I only managed to read one book to my son: *You Choose Superman: Superman Day Disaster*. He reads a lot on his own now.

I did manage to read seventeen books to my daughter:

* Dr. Suess's Oh, Baby! Go, Baby!
* Fancy Nancy Nancy's Fancy Heirloom
* How Old is Mr. Tortoise?
* Huggapotamus
* Not a Box
* Put Me in the Zoo
* Sleep Tight, Disgusting Blob
* The Berenstain Bears Get Stage Fright
* The Berenstain Bears and Too Much TV
* The Nose Book
* The Snow Queen
* What If You Had Animal Ears?
* Wherever You Are My Love Will Find You
* Who is That, Cat the Cat?
* Will the Pigeon Graduate?
* Would You Like to Play Hide & Seek in this Book with Lovable, Furry Old Grover?
* You Choose Superman Superman Day Disaster

As for me, I read to books: *How Not to Age* by Dr. Michael Greger and *You Can Retire Sooner Than You Think* by Wes Moss.

*How Not to Age* was a bit dense and was 50% citations - seriously, the book was over at the 50% mark (I read via [Libby](https://libbyapp.com/) and [Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=kindle&tag=hendrixjoseph-20)) with the remaining half citations.

*You Can Retire Sooner Than You Think* was okay. I don't get much out of reading finance books anymore, but I picked this one up because I'm beginning to consider my draw down phase.

That's it for this month's book reading post.
