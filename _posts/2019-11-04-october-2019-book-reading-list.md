Another month over, another book reading list.

It's crazy I've been doing these "book reading lists" for almost two years now - my first was in [January 2018](https://www.joehxblog.com/january-2018-book-reading-list/) - although I did skip the month of February 2019.

## Books I Read to My Son

What's also crazy is that I've been consistently reading to my son almost since the day he was born.

My first "book reading list" that mentions reading to him is [April 2018](April 2018 Book Reading List) - and really couldn't have been any sooner, since he was born at the end of March.

Here's what I read to him this month:

I was able to find the publisher's website - [Flying Frog Publishing](https://www.flyingfrogpub.com/). And plenty of books pop up when searching [Flying Frog Publishing](https://www.amazon.com/Flying-Frog-Publishing-Books/s?k=Flying+Frog+Publishing&rh=n%3A283155&tag=hendrixjoseph-20) on Amazon.

## The ~~Books~~ Stories I Read for Me

I've trying to finish the "book" I'm reading now - [99 Classic Science-Fiction Short Stories](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RKSDTFP/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) - as quickly as possible.
