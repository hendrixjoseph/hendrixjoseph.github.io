Ten years of income reports. Ten years of transparency.

These reports have evolved over time. A few years ago, I used to do them and the end of the year. However, there was also a few pennies that came in after I wrote the report, so I needed to do them in the beginning of the year.

Here are the previous nine income reports:

* [2024 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2024-end-of-year-side-income-report/)
* [2023 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2023-end-of-year-side-income-report/)
* [2022 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2022-end-of-year-side-income-report/)
* [2021 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2021-end-of-year-side-income-report/)
* [2020 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2020-end-of-year-side-income-report/)
* [2019 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2019-end-of-year-side-income-report/)
* [2018 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2018-end-of-year-side-income-report/)
* [2017 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2017-end-of-year-side-income-report/)
* [2016 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2016-end-of-year-side-income-report/)

As it has come to be, I'll organize my side income into separate categories, then total them up at the end. This year I've removed the *cryptocurrency* category and added a *class action settlement* category. That will probably change again next year - unless I get a slew of class action settlements again this year.

## Credit Card Rewards

* Citi Double Cash &rarr; $904.61
* [Chase Freedom](https://www.joehxblog.com/chase-freedom/) &rarr; $268.49
* [Chase Freedom Flex](https://www.joehxblog.com/chase-freedom/) &rarr; $601.80
* [Chase Freedom Unlimited](https://www.joehxblog.com/chase-freedom-unlimited/) &rarr; $300.14
* [Chase Amazon Prime Visa](https://www.joehxblog.com/prime-visa/) &rarr; $614.37
* US Bank Cash+ &rarr; $156.16
* [Capital One Quicksilver](https://www.joehxblog.com/capital-one-quicksilver/) &rarr; $13.86
* Verizon Visa &rarr; $593.58
* Total &rarr; $3,453.01

This year I opened up the [Chase Amazon Prime Visa](https://www.joehxblog.com/prime-visa/), netting me at least 5% on my Amazon purchases. I'll sometimes get more if I delay the shipment, however.

My base card is, of course, the the Citi Double Cash, netting gets me 2% cash back on everything.

Last year I didn't count the "Verizon Dollars" earned on my Verizon Visa. This year I'm only counting *the Verizon Dollars spent on my Verizon bill*. Over the twelve month period of 2025, my Verizon bills totaled $714.28, but I only spend out-of-pocket $120,70, meaning I used $593.58 Verizon dollars, which is the amount I'm reporting above.

## Interest-Bearing Accounts

* [Ally Interest](https://www.joehxblog.com/ally/) &rarr;  $2,554.86
* Vanguard &rarr; $1,477.77

* [Coinbase](https://www.joehxblog.com/coinbase/) Staking &rarr; $2.10
* Total &rarr; $7,011.85

Most of these are from accounts I may receive a [1099-INT](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-int) or [1099-DIV](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-div) for. I probably won't for the Coinbase crypto staking, but nevertheless I do report that on my [Schedule B](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-schedule-b-form-1040).

## Print-On-Demand Sites

* [Merch by Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=%22joehx%22&i=fashion&tag=hendrixjoseph-20) &rarr; $912.56
* [TeePublic](https://www.joehxblog.com/teepublic/) &rarr; $13.50
* Amazon Kindle Direct &rarr; $27.72
* Total &rarr; $953.78

I did publish another word search book last year - [The Ultimate Nature Word Search Book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7G9CX7M?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). I don't believe it has sold any copies yet.

What did sell where two previous word searches I published - [The Ultimate Cybersecurity Word Search Puzzle Book](https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Cybersecurity-Word-Search-Puzzle/dp/B0D7MYZB7Y/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) and [The Ultimate Programming Word Search Puzzle Book](https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Programming-Word-Search-Puzzle/dp/B0D9241RQD/).

My t-shirt sales, at least on Amazon, continue to do well, despite me not doing much with it.

## Blogging

* Google AdSense &rarr; $0.00
* Amazon Associates &rarr; $22.29
* Total &rarr; $22.29

I didn't receive any AdSense payments last year. In order to receive payment, my AdSense balance needs to hit $100. As I write this, my balance is sitting at $76.21. Perhaps I'll get paid this year?

## Class Action Settlements

* Facebook Settlement &rarr; $114.87
* Equifax Settlement &rarr; $7.44
* Mednax Services Settlement &rarr; $106.00

It's nice that these numbers continue to rise. Here are the previous years, and only a couple years did I make less than the previous (2018 and 2020):
