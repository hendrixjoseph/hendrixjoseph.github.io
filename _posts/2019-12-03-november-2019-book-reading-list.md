This is the final book reading list I'll be writing this year - since I write about the previous month at the beginning of the next, I won't be writing December 2019's until January 2020.

A whole 'nother decade.

## The ~~Books~~ Stories I Read for Me

I finally finished the book I've been reading since July - [99 Classic Science-Fiction Short Stories](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RKSDTFP/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20).

I finished the final 25 stories:

77. *Piper in the Woods* by Philip K. Dick

79. *The Defenders* by Philip K. Dick
80. *The Eyes Have It* by Philip K. Dick

98. *Professor's Van Wagener's Eye* by W.L. Alden

I've begun reading my next book already. It's much shorter, and non-fiction - going with my fiction/non-fiction/fiction/non-fiction pattern I've been aiming for.

The book I'm reading now (which I'll name next month after I've finished it) should help me with one of my [2019 goals](https://www.joehxblog.com/2019-new-years-resolutions-goals/) - although I have less than a month to do said goal!

That's it for now. Feel free to comment below what you've been reading recently!
