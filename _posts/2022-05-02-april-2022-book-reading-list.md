## The Books I Read for Me

I finished [The Return of the King](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007978P18/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20), which means I have now completed the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I can now move on to a different fiction series.

I also finished [Faster Road Racing: 5K to Half Marathon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LPICJ82/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). I've already been running for a couple years now; I'm trying to do better at it.
