2021 is more than half over - which makes this a good time to look at how far along I am at accomplishing [my goals for this year](https://www.joehxblog.com/2021-new-years-resolutions-goals/).

## The Goals I'm Missing

* Improve our parenting skills by either taking a parenting class (preferably) or reading a book
* Volunteer at church at least once
* Attend at least one marriage seminar or retreat
* Become 100% debt free
* Eat out no more than 1x week on average
* Attend at least one marriage seminar or retreat
* Reach a body fat percentage of 20% or lower
* Daily run to a 5-minute walk, 40-minute run, 5-minute walk
* Attend at least one conference
* Finish the [fast.ai course](https://course.fast.ai/)
* Max out my bonus 5% grocery category with my new [Chase Freedom Flex](https://www.joehxblog.com/chase-freedom/) card.

I haven't seen any parenting classes or marriage seminars available - hopefully, some will be available as the pandemic fizzles out.

I *would* be 100% debt-free, but I financed a [Google Pixel 4a phone](https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-4a-Unlocked-Smartphone/dp/B08CFSZLQ4/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) at 0% interest for the same cost a paying for it outright.

My body fat has stubbornly stayed around 21%. This morning I was at 21.5%. But look how close I got a month ago:

I'm starting to consistently be able to run for at least 20 minutes - I still have a bit to go before I hit the 40-minute mark.

I've yet to attend a conference, but I am registered to attend the [2021 Libertarian Party of Ohio Conference](https://lpo.org/event/2021-libertarian-party-of-ohio-conference/) next month.

And apparently, I only have one lesson left in the [fast.ai course](https://course.fast.ai/) - I might as well watch the video to say I completed the course.

I'm *close* to maxing out the [Chase Freedom Flex](https://www.joehxblog.com/chase-freedom/) grocery bonus - at 82% of the first year complete, I've spent 82% necessary to max the bonus.

## The Goals Weâ€™re Making

* Max out our Roth IRAs & HSA
* Max the match on our 401ks
* Up our 529 contributions from $25 to $30 a month per kid
* Up our church donations from $50 to $100 a month
* Figure out what to do after debt
* Read at least one book to each kid every day
* Hike as a family at least once a week (typically on the weekend)
* Sign up our son for preschool
* Potty train son
* Enjoy our daughter learning to walk and talk
* Max two hours of TV for the kids only on the weekends. No TV during the week.
* Have at least seven dates
* Maintain my weight at 225 lbs or less
* Run at least one 5k
* Continue [strength training](https://www.joehxblog.com/my-exercise-routine/)
* Run for city council
* Read (i.e. finish) one book per month
* Remove the jQuery dependencies on my blog
* Clean up my blog's CSS
* Continue with the [Blog Statistics](https://www.joehxblog.com/tags/blog-statistics/), [Book Reading List](https://www.joehxblog.com/tags/reading-list/), and [End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/tags/income-report/) series

As far as figuring out what to do with our money after debt, we've both increased our 401k contributes to put at least the $19,500 max into each. In fact, we'll both be able to put more than the max - both accounts have the same verbiage:

> If your pre-tax and Roth 401(k) contributions to the Plan reach the maximum amount permitted by law, the Plan will redirect your pre-tax and Roth 401(k) contribution rates to an after-tax savings contribution rate. This will allow company matching contributions to continue until the maximum combined contribution limit is reached. Your pre-tax and Roth 401(k) contribution rates will change when you elect a different rate, or a new plan year begins.

I'm also - carefully - maxing out my [solo 401k](https://www.joehxblog.com/i-opened-a-vanguard-individual-401k/). I say carefully because the most I can put it is 20% - if I decide to expense something, that will lower what 20% means.

I've not only run one 5k, I've run *three* and plan on running more. The three I've run so far are, with times:

* [Vandalia 5k (2021)](https://orrrc.org/vandalia-5k-results-2021/) on May 12th - time 35::36.2
* [Hobart Urban Nature Preserve 5k](https://runsignup.com/Race/Results/56176/IndividualResult/MJCb?resultSetId=257747#U48346758) on June 13th - time 42:47.5
7/11/2021
* [Lost Creek Reserve 5k](https://runsignup.com/Race/Results/56190/IndividualResult/MJfH?resultSetId=262303#U48346758) on July 11th - time 36:37.2

That's it for now. How are your goals going?
