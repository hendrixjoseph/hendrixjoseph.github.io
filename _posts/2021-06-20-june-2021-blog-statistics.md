It's the twentieth. It's time for another blog stats post.

Note that the charts won't be updated for about a week - for now now they'll just be broken images.

I wrote nine posts this month:

The most posts I've ever written in a month were in [July 2019](https://www.joehxblog.com/july-2019-blog-statistics/) and [September 2019](https://www.joehxblog.com/september-2019-blog-statistics/) with eight posts in each month. I was really hustling back then.

I haven't written any posts over on [my campaign site](https://joe4huberheights.com).
