My daughter loves to make a big pile of books and then bring them over, asking me to read each one. This means I might read ten or so books in one sitting to her.

My son reads books every night to himself. Which means I'm not reading as much to him. Compare the 31 books I read to my daughter to the two books I read to him.

Oh, and I read two books for myself.

## The Books I Read for Me

I continued with the Foundation series with [Second Foundation](https://www.amazon.com/Second-Foundation-Isaac-Asimov-ebook/dp/B000FC1PWU/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). After that, I only have two books left in the series (and I'm currently reading the next one).

For non-fiction, I read [PProofiness: How You're Being Fooled by the Numbers by Charles Seife](https://www.amazon.com/Proofiness-Youre-Being-Fooled-Numbers-ebook/dp/B0042VJ1OE/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). An entertaining read, the book describes the bad math used by people - such as politicians - who shape our world. Sometimes intentionally, sometimes not. It's not just theory - real-world examples are given throughout the book.
