2023 is over. This post will mark the 71st regular monthly book reading post - the first one from [January 2018](https://www.joehxblog.com/january-2018-book-reading-list/).

Which is amazing since that's before [my son was born](https://www.joehxblog.com/life-update/). And I've had a daughter since then, too.

So last month, in December, I read 10 different books to my son and 24 different books to my daughter.

I was only able to finish one book for me.

## The Books I Read for Me

Wanting to understand health better, I read [Good Calories, Bad Calories by by Gary Taubes](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Calories-Bad-Gary-Taubes-ebook/dp/B000UZNSC2/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). It was a bit more history than health than I expected, however.
