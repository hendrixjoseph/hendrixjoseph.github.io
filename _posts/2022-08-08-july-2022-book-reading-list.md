Another month has come and gone - meaning, on this blog at least, it's time for another book reading report.

I read 26 books to my son and 12 books to my daughter.

I finished one book for myself - but I also didn't finish (and won't finish) another book.

## The Books I Read for Me

I started reading [Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before?](https://www.amazon.com/Why-Nobody-Told-This-Before-ebook/dp/B0983L6T32/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) by Dr. Julie Smith. I didn't finish it, though. It's not that the book was bad, it's just I wasn't getting anything out of it. It might have been more helpful if I read it ten or twenty years ago.

So I picked up another non-fiction book in an entirely different domain - Pro Git 2nd Edition. The ebook is free at [the Git website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) and seems to be [perpetually free on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Pro-Git-Scott-Chacon-ebook-dp-B01ISNIKES/dp/B01ISNIKES/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). (The [print book](https://www.amazon.com/Pro-Git-Scott-Chacon/dp/1484200772/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) is like fifty bucks, though.)

I found the Pro Git book to be quite useful, albeit a bit outdated. It's for Git 2.0, whereas Git is currently on version 2.37.1 and has has a number of new commands (most notably `[git switch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-switch)`).
