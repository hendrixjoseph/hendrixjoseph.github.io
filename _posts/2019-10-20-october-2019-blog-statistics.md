It's Sunday, October 20th, 2019, and time for another monthly blog stats report.

Since it's the weekend, I'm just going to throw up the numbers.

Also, remember I have [a CSV file with almost two year's worth of data](https://github.com/hendrixjoseph/hendrixjoseph.github.io/blob/master/_data/blog-stats.csv) if you want to get lost in a lot of numbers.

I was able to publish six posts this month:

* [My Experience Refinancing my Auto Loan](https://www.joehxblog.com/my-experience-refinancing-my-auto-loan/)
* [How Does Google Know?](https://www.joehxblog.com/how-does-google-know/)
* [Revamping the Vandalia Toastmasters Website](https://www.joehxblog.com/revamping-the-vandalia-toastmasters-website/)
* [Applying for a Spot on the Planning Commission of Huber Heights](https://www.joehxblog.com/applying-for-a-spot-on-the-planning-commision-of-huber-heights/)
* [September 2019 Book Reading List](https://www.joehxblog.com/september-2019-book-reading-list/)
* [The Event Supply Mission Items to Get During the Week in Star Trek Timelines](https://www.joehxblog.com/the-event-supply-mission-items-to-get-during-the-week-in-star-trek-timelines/)
