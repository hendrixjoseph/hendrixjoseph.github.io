I've been busy, but not with this blog. Here are the August 2024 statistics.

I only wrote two posts:

* [July 2024 Book Reading List](https://www.joehxblog.com/july-2024-book-reading-list/)
* [Is Running a More Efficient Way to Travel Than Walking?](https://www.joehxblog.com/is-running-a-more-efficient-way-to-travel-than-walking/)

The numbers were boosted a bit this month due to the second post above being shared by [freediver](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=freediver) on Hacker News: <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41198931>.
