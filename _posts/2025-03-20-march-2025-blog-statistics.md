It's March. I was going to say this is the first time I've only published on blog post for my monther blog stats post, but it seems I've done it three other times: [September 2024](https://www.joehxblog.com/september-2024-blog-statistics/), [August 2023](https://www.joehxblog.com/august-2023-blog-statistics/), and [October 2021](https://www.joehxblog.com/october-2021-blog-statistics/).

That means this is the fourth time I've only made one post - and that post is, of course, my monthly book reading list, aka [February 2025 Book Reading List](https://www.joehxblog.com/february-2025-book-reading-list/).
