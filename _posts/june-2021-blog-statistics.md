For the forty-first time, it's the twentieth. Well, actually it's probably the gazillionth time it's the twentieth - but this is my 41st blog stats post.

That's right, I've been consistently doing these posts since [January 2018](https://www.joehxblog.com/january-2018-blog-statistics/).

I wrote nine posts this month:

* [Interesting Reads for the Week Ending June 18th](https://www.joehxblog.com/june-18-2021-interesting-reads/)
* [Java Collections Framework - Set Interface Method Examples](https://www.joehxblog.com/set-interface-method-examples/)
* [Interesting Reads for the Week Ending June 11th](https://www.joehxblog.com/june-11-2021-interesting-reads/)
* [Interesting Reads for the Week Ending June 4th](https://www.joehxblog.com/june-4-2021-interesting-reads/)
* [May 2021 Book Reading List](https://www.joehxblog.com/may-2021-book-reading-list/)
* [Java Collections Framework - Map Interface Method Examples](https://www.joehxblog.com/map-interface-method-examples/)

The most posts I've ever written in a month were in [July 2019](https://www.joehxblog.com/july-2019-blog-statistics/) and [September 2019](https://www.joehxblog.com/september-2019-blog-statistics/) with eight posts in each month. I was really hustling back then.

I haven't written any posts over on [my campaign site](https://joe4huberheights.com).
