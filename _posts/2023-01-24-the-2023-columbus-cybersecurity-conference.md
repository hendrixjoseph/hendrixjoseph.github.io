Back in 2019, I attended the [2019 Cincinnati Cybersecurity Conference](https://www.joehxblog.com/the-2019-cincinnati-cybersecurity-conference/) by [Data Connectors](https://www.dataconnectors.com/).

Since then, it's rolled around a few times.

In 2020, it was virtual; I attended, but it wasn't as good as in-person.

It was also virtual in 2021. I didn't attend that one.

In 2022, it was back to being in-person. I wasn't able to attend.

But last week it was held in [Columbus, Ohio](https://dataconnectors.com/events/2023/january/columbus/), and I *was* able to attend.

So how did it go?

I felt like the one I attended [back in 2019](https://www.joehxblog.com/the-2019-cincinnati-cybersecurity-conference/) was better. But it's not like this one was bad.

I only talked with vendors. There was a social hour afterwards where I could've talked with more people, but I needed to head home to take care of my kids.

Lunch was good - the protein was a choice between chicken or salmon - I, of course, chose a little of both.

Swag was good, although no [Yubikey](https://www.amazon.com/Yubico-YubiKey-USB-Authentication-Security/dp/B07HBD71HL/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) this time. I got a couple of t-shirts, a few socks (why socks?), plenty of pens, and a notebook.

The best, other than the notebook, were [power banks](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=power+bank&tag=hendrixjoseph-20). I got two.

Oh - and a signed copy of a hardcover edition of [No Safe Harbor: The Inside Truth About Cybercrime by Mark Sangster](https://www.amazon.com/No-Safe-Harbor-Cybercrime_and-Business/dp/1989603424/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). I didn't really care about getting it signed; I just wanted the free book (sorry, Mark).

Oh, and I got my bald head on Twitter - I'm on the bottom right in the maroon sweater:
