Do you want more traffic, but don't know where to start? Are you on Quora? Did you know you can use Quora to get traffic to your blog?

In fact - I've made it super easy. I've created a space on Quora dedicated to sharing blog posts.

## What is Quora?

Quora is a question-and-answer website, akin to Reddit - more specifically, the [/r/Ask... series of subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/sidebarsubs), such as [/r/AskReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/) and [/r/AskScience]().

Unlike Reddit, answers on Quora tend to be longer-format and more in-depth. Also, Quora has a stronger emphasis on images in the content.

Similar to Reddit, you can share links to Quora.

That's where my [Blog Share](https://www.quora.com/q/ceemghembxcgsyld) space comes in.

## The Blog Share Space

The [Blog Share space on Quora](https://www.quora.com/q/ceemghembxcgsyld) is dedicated to sharing blog posts of any type. No need to fear getting rejected, just share a blog link of yours and enjoy any feedback you get from fellow contributors!

There are a few rules for the [Blog Share space](https://www.quora.com/q/ceemghembxcgsyld), however:

1. No porn.
2. No glorification of violence (this is not to say you canâ€™t link to a  review of violent media such as violent films or video games).
3. Share at most one blog post a day.
4. Please give a short description of your blog post when you share it.

I look forward to seeing your contributions and helping you drive traffic to your blog with Quora!
