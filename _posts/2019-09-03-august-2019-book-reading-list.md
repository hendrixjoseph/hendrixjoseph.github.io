My son has gotten really into looking at books lately. He absolutely loves flipping through his books.

I blame that my wife and I have been reading to him regularly since pretty much the day he was born. He was born towards the end of March 2018, and I first reported what books I read to him in my [April 2018 Book Reading List](https://www.joehxblog.com/april-2018-book-reading-list/).

And - cliche as it may be - he's changed *so much* over his year-and-a-half of life. Right now he's a *ton* of fun.

And he thinks I'm the funniest person ever. He certainly has a lot to learn!

## The Book I Read for Me

I'm still working on the same book I was last month. Well, it's a collection of short stories.

The "book" is the Kindle book [99 Classic Science-Fiction Short Stories: Works by Philip K. Dick, Ray Bradbury, Isaac Asimov, H.G. Wells, Edgar Allan Poe, Seabury Quinn, Jack London...and many more! (99 Readym Anthologies Book 2)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RKSDTFP/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20).

Basically, someone grabbed a bunch of old, public domain stories and put them up as a single Kindle e-book.  I found it free via [a free ebook subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/FreeEBOOKS+KindleFreebies/).

As the title suggests, there are 99 short stories. Last month I read stories 20 through 34:

20. *The Facts of M. Valdemar's Case* by Edgar Allan Poe
21. *The Power of Words* by Edgar Allan Poe
22. *The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether* by Edgar Allan Poe
23. *The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Scheherazade* by Edgar Allan Poe
24. *Von Kempelen and His Discovery* by Edgar Allan Poe
25. *The Man from Mars* by Edgar Fawcett
26. *The House That Would Not Wait* by Ellis Parker Butler
27. *Wetter New York* by Ellis Parker Butler
28. *The War of the Giants* by Fletcher Pratt
29. *The Dancer in the Crystal* by Francis Flagg
30. *The Mentanicals* by Francis Flagg
31. *The Golden Hour of Kwoh Fan* by Frank Owen
32. *A Tale of Negative Gravity* by Frank R. Stockton
33. *The Balance of Nature* by Fred M. White
34. *The Thing Fromâ€”"Outside"* by George Allan England

So, I guess I'm not even halfway through yet? Off to my Kindle, then!
