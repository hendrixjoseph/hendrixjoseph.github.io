Like many of you who are still working, I'm working at home now. Thankfully, I can take our kids to my wife's parent's house while we both work at home.

None of this has stopped us from reading to our kids. And I keep reading for myself, as well.

## The Books I Read for Me

I read two books for me.

The first book I read - [You Have the Right to Remain Innocent](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DAD218W/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) - I picked up after learning about a [$3 Amazon Kindle credit from Doctor of Credit's site](https://www.doctorofcredit.com/amazon-kindle-3-credit-towards-select-titles/).

[You Have the Right to Remain Innocent](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DAD218W/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) talks about the importance of *not talking to the police*. It explains that it's the police's job to find evidence against you - even if you're innocent. The police are allowed to lie to you - but you may not be legally allowed to lie to the police. In other words, get a lawyer.

The second book I read - [The Internet of Money](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01L9WM0H8/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) - I picked up via free [Prime Reading](https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/fd/nonprime-pr/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20).

This book is mostly about Bitcoin - although you could argue it's about cryptocurrency in general. Honestly, I felt that the book was a shill for bitcoin. "Bitcoin is great because bitcoin is great!" It makes more sense when you read the first line in the description of the book: "While many books explain the how of bitcoin, [The Internet of Money](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01L9WM0H8/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) delves into the why of bitcoin."

The book is just a compilation of speeches and presentations that the author, [Andreas M. Antonopoulos](https://www.amazon.com/Andreas-M-Antonopoulos/e/B00MVAG8Z8/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20), has given on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.

Here are some of his presentations on YouTube:
