It seems Google Timeline for Web Maps will be going away. Which means I will no longer be able to check on the status of my globe-trotting adventures on the web.

Thankfully, Google Timeline isn't going *completely* away. It's just going to be stored completely on device. At some point, the Google Maps app on your phone should send you a push notification saying the web portion will be going away and you need to do some sort of update if you want to keep your data; I have no idea when or how soon, though.

Which, as much as I hate not being able to see my history on my desktop, is a net good. Google won't be able to provide this data when subpoenaed because *they won't have the data*.

Here's a couple of Google Support topics on the issue (some only tangentially so):

* [Update Google Maps to use Timeline on your device](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/14169818)
