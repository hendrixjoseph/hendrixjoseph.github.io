Spring is halfway over and it's the 20th. Time for another Blog Stat report.

I made three posts in the past month:

* [Lazily Check the Body of an HttpServletRequest](https://www.joehxblog.com/lazily-check-the-body-of-an-httpservletrequest/)
* [30 Years of Programming & My First Programs](https://www.joehxblog.com/30-years-of-programming/)
* [April 2022 Book Reading List](https://www.joehxblog.com/april-2022-book-reading-list/)

## Alexa

Alexa is no more. Going to [my Alexa site info page](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/joehxblog.com) you'll see the following message:

> ## End of Service Notice
>
> We retired Alexa.com on May 1, 2022, after more than two decades of helping you find, reach, and convert your digital audience. Thank you for making us your go-to resource for content research, competitive analysis, keyword research, and so much more.

However, I have the Alexa browser extension on Firefox which still gives me data. In addition to giving me my global rank, it pops up a  little message that reads:

> ## End of Service Notice
>
> We retired Alexa.com on May 1, 2022, after more than two decades of helping you find, reach, and convert your digital audience. Thank you for making us your go-to resource for content research, competitive analysis, keyword research, and so much more. Though Alexa.com has been retired, your browser extension will continue serving Alexa Traffic Ranks until December 2022.

So I guess I have until the end of this year to keep reporting this number.
