New year, new goals. Or at least updated goals.

![Goals 2022](/images/goals-2022.jpg)

I used to not be a new-years-resolution guy. I didn't see the point in waiting for the new year to set goals. I still don't - I'll set goals for myself throughout the year. But my wife likes them, and it is a good time for us to sit together and talk about what we want to accomplish in the coming year.

I've been publishing these goals on this blog since 2018. If you want to see the previous four years, here are the links:

* [2021 New Year's Resolutions & Goals](https://www.joehxblog.com/2021-new-years-resolutions-goals/)
* [2020 New Year's Resolutions & Goals](https://www.joehxblog.com/2021-new-years-resolutions-goals/)
* [2018 New Year's Resolutions & Goals](https://www.joehxblog.com/2021-new-years-resolutions-goals/)
* [2019 New Year's Resolutions & Goals](https://www.joehxblog.com/2021-new-years-resolutions-goals/)

As my goal-setting has evolved, one thing has remained constant: setting *abstract goals* that outline what I want to accomplish, and then for each abstract goal setting a *concrete goal* that is specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-bound. Y'know, [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria).

## Improve Our Finances

* Max out our Roth IRAs ($6,000 each in 2022)
* Max out our employer 401(k) accounts ($20,500 each in 2022)
* Max out my [i401(k) account](https://www.joehxblog.com/i-opened-a-vanguard-individual-401k/) (roughly 20% of any self-employment income)
* Invest any extra [self-employment or other side income](https://www.joehxblog.com/tags/#income-report) money
* $35 per kid per month to their 529 accounts
* Eat out no more than one time a week as a family
* Get take out no more than one time a week while working from home

## Improve My Health

* Track my food and exercise with [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/profile/joehx84)
* Track my running, walking, and hiking with [MapMyRun](https://www.mapmyrun.com/)
* Track my weight and body fat percentage with our [smart scale](https://www.amazon.com/Weight-Gurus-Bluetooth-Smart-Scale/dp/B00UVSCEAU/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) and the [Weight Gurus](https://weightgurus.com/) app.
* Continue strength training
* Get down to 17% body fat - which is around 199lbs
* Run 50 minutes non-stop
* Run a 5k in less than 30 minutes

For the 5ks, I will be renewing our membership in the [Ohio River Road Runners Club](https://orrrc.org/) within the next few days.

To bring my strength training to the next level, late last year we joined our local [YMCA](https://www.daytonymca.org/). I wanted to start bench pressing, and my wife agreed that we should join as a family.

I also have these [fitness goals from a previous post](https://www.joehxblog.com/setting-my-fitness-goals/):

* Waist to 36 inches
* Chest to 44 inches
* Bicep to equal neck (so about 16 inches)

## Improve Personally & Professionally

* Read at least one book per month
* Attend at least one conference
* Get situated at my new job
* Perform well at my new job
* Donate blood at least once

## Be Better Parents & Our Goals for Our Kids

* Read at least one book to each kid every day
* Hike as a family at least once a week (typically on the weekend)
* Max two hours of TV for the kids only on the weekends. No TV during the week
* One special activity a month with the kids
* Improve our parenting skills by either taking a parenting class (preferably) or reading a book
* Say prayers at bedtime and mealtime

We also have the following goals for our son:

* Participate in chores
* Ride his bike more
* Learn to write his name

This goal is not happening, though:

As for our daughter, we've set the following goals:

* Potty trained
* Know her ABCs
* Can count from 1 through 20
* Know basic shapes
* Know basic colors
* Able to dress and undress herself

## Our Together Goals

* Volunteer at church at least once
* Minimum of eight dates
* Clean our computer room - it's our work-at-home room!

## My Wife's Goals

My wife's goals are the standard lose weight, exercise, and better self-care. There are details, but this isn't her blog and she'd rather I not share those details with the world.

I can say that she wants to earn more [PTCP](https://www.ptcb.org/) CEUs for her job and that she wants to read at least six books this year.

Other than that, you'll have to ask her if you know her.

Do you have any goals for 2022?
