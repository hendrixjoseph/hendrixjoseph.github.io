January 2024 is in the books.

Speaking of books, it's time for my monthly book reading list.

As my son - who'll be six soon - reads more and more, I read to him less and less. My wife has him read to himself for 15 minutes every night. He likes to set the timer on [my watch](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MYT8XH2/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) and wear it while he reads for those fifteen month.

I only read seven different books to him.

On the other hand, I read 22 different books to my daughter.

For me, I was only able to finish one book.

## The Books I Read for Me

I read [The Oppenheimer Alternative by Robert J. Sawyer](https://www.amazon.com/Oppenheimer-Alternative-Robert-J-Sawyer-ebook/dp/B084H26X5S/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20).

I *nearly* finished the next book in January - I finished it on February 1st. You'll just have to wait until next month to find out what it was!
