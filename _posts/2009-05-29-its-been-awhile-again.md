I haven’t posted in a while (no time travel excuse this time), so I’m going to just post a quick link:

[Orange Grove: It’s time to nationalize grocery stores](http://www.ocregister.com/articles/food-government-new-2425213-groceries-commissaries)

This is a satirical news article. If you’ve read some of my previous blogs, you might’ve caught on that I’m a fan of small government. As nice as a guy as Pres Obama is, I don’t like what he’s doing.

So enjoy the article. Yeah, I’m lazy.

Until next time

Joe
