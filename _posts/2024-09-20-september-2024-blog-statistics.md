For the first time in almost ten years, I effectively wrote no posts in the past month. The only post I did write was my standard monthly book-reading post:

* [August 2024 Book Reading List](https://www.joehxblog.com/august-2024-book-reading-list/)

I've been busy with a couple of side projects.

So, without further ado, here are the September 2024 blog stats!
