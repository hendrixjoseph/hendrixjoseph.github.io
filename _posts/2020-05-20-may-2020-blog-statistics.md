Rolling out the monthly blog stats in the middle of this pandemic.

This month I wrote four different posts:

* [April 2020 Book Reading List](https://www.joehxblog.com/april-2020-book-reading-list/)
* [How To Find All Assignments to a Variable in Eclipse](https://www.joehxblog.com/how-to-find-all-assignments-to-a-variable-in-eclipse/)
* [An Idea to Deal with the Flaw with Cash Bail](https://www.joehxblog.com/an-idea-to-deal-with-the-flaw-with-cash-bail/)
