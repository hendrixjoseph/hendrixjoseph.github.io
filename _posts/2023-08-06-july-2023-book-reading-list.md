More and more my son is reading on his own. And my daughter is trying to mimic her older brother and "read" on her own, too.

Which means I read less and less to them.

But I still read to them. 13 books to my son and 21 books to my daughter.

## The Books I Read for Me

And me? I read [An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QYCHJ7V/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). I'm no manager, but I'm trying to understand the position more.
