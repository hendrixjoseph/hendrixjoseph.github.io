Time flies. Halloween and October are over, November is here and it's almost time for Thanksgiving.

I read nine different books to my son and twelve different books to my daughter, which are low numbers compared to how much a typically read to them.

I read two books for me - the normal non-fiction book followed by a fiction book.

## The Books I Read for Me

I've been trying to read less self-help books and more "sciencey" books, so last month I read Neil deGrasse Tyson's [Astrophysics for People in a Hurry](https://www.amazon.com/Astrophysics-People-Hurry-Grasse-Tyson-ebook/dp/B01MAWT2MO/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20).

For my non-fiction book I read [Babel: Or the Necessity of Violence: An Arcane History of the Oxford Translators' Revolution](https://www.amazon.com/Babel-Necessity-Violence-Translators-Revolution-ebook/dp/B09MD95S5V/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) by R. F. Kuang. It's an alternate history book, but only in the sense that there is magic - but the magic has a strict set of rules based on translation. It's a academia book along the lines of Harry Potty - but much deeper, and more intellectual than Harry Potty. It also brings in the concepts of colonialism and oppression. All-in-all, I am glad I read in and enjoyed it.
