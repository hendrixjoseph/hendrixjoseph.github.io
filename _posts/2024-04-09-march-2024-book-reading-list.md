March is over. Then the kids had a week of spring break - which included the April 8th Total Solar Eclipse.

Now it's time for my monthly book reading list.

I ended up reading ten different books to my son and eighteen different books to my daughter.

And I read only a single book for myself.

## The Books I Read for Me

I read the [American Gods](https://www.amazon.com/American-Gods-Novel-Neil-Gaiman/dp/0063081911/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) novel.
