I wrote another book. Two books, really. Two word search puzzle books.

These are my first books since publishing a [coloring book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJ7XVL9D/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) in 2022 and a [Sudoku puzzle book](https://www.joehxblog.com/i-published-my-first-low-content-kdp-book-a-sudoku-puzzle-book/) in 2019.

These two new word search books? [The Ultimate Cybersecurity Word Search Puzzle Book](https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Cybersecurity-Word-Search-Puzzle/dp/B0D7MYZB7Y/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) & [The Ultimate Programming Word Search Puzzle Book](https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Programming-Word-Search-Puzzle/dp/B0D9241RQD/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20).

If you can't tell by the two themes, I'm a software engineer by trade. I wrote the software to create the books (using [Java](https://www.java.com/), [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/), and [Flying Saucer](https://github.com/flyingsaucerproject/flyingsaucer)) - that was part of the fun, too.

To celebrate publishing these two books, I'm going to giveaway a copy of each. Simply use the Rafflecopter entry widget below, and when it's over, I'll ship the books straight to you!
