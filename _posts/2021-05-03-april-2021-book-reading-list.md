Time marches on. It is now May, and it is now time to report what books I read - to myself, to my son, and to my daughter - in April.

## The Books I Read for Me

I finished not one - not two - but three books in April.

That's right - 3 books in April!

The first book was [How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WEAI4E?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). Published in 1936, it contains timeless tips on how to get people to do what you want. **Simply put, the only way to get people to do what you want them to do is to get them to want to do it.** Of course, implementation is never as easy as the concept.

The second book was [Brain Wave by Poul Anderson](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FFNKL1D/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). In this science fiction book, everyone - no, everything - starts getting smarter. A bit different, but a good read nevertheless.

And the third book was [The Middle Ages: A History From Beginning to End](https://www.amazon.com/Middle-Ages-History-Beginning-End-ebook/dp/B01D8REDQ8/) by [Hourly History](https://www.amazon.com/Hourly-History/e/B01HXXGBSQ?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). Hourly History publishes a bunch of quick reads meant to be read in (you guessed it) one hour. They also give away their books fairly often. You can either look at their Amazon page or check out their [blog](https://www.hourlyhistory.com/blog/) to see what books they have that are free.
