New Year. A quarter of a century into the 2000s. And time for yearly goals.

![Goals 2025](/images/goals-2025.jpg)

This will be the seventh year I've made a post with these goals. Here's the previous six:

* [2024 New Year's Resolutions & Goals](https://www.joehxblog.com/2024-new-years-resolutions-goals/)
* [2023 New Year's Resolutions & Goals](https://www.joehxblog.com/2023-new-years-resolutions-goals/)

* [2020 New Year's Resolutions & Goals](https://www.joehxblog.com/2020-new-years-resolutions-goals/)
* [2019 New Year's Resolutions & Goals](https://www.joehxblog.com/2019-new-years-resolutions-goals/)
* [2018 New Year's Resolutions & Goals](https://www.joehxblog.com/2018-new-years-resolutions-goals/)

I've come to organize my goals into four over-arching abstract goals: improve our finances, improve my health, improve personally & professionally, and 
focus on family. Each abstract goal is action-oriented - grammatically, that means it needs to be a verb or verb phrase. For each abstract goal, I have concrete goals which, for the most part, should have a number or something measurable that lets me know if that goal was met.

## Improve Our Finances

* Max out our Roth IRAs ($7,000 each in 2025).
  * We're blessed enough that we were able to do this in a single transaction (well, two transactions, one for each account) on January 2nd.
* Max out the Ohio tax benefit for the kids' 529 accounts ($4,000 per kid).
  * Again, we were able to do this in a single transaction for each account on January 8th.
* Max out our employer Roth 401(k) accounts ($23,500 each in 2025).
  * To max out our match (and not worry about any company true-up, if applicable) we have to spread this out per paycheck.
* Max out my [i401(k) account](https://www.joehxblog.com/i-opened-a-vanguard-individual-401k/) (roughly 20% of any self-employment income)
  * Generally I like to not contribute to the current year until after tax season is over, any any contribution I make before April 15 is marked for the previous year. There's always a couple more bucks I can contribute once I'm figuring out taxes.

## Improve My Health

* Weigh between just under 200 lbs and 190 lbs.
  * I did ok on this last year - 48 of 149 of my weigh-ins, or 32%, we under 200 pounds - see below chart.
* Build muscle:
  * I'm currently taking a strength-training class at my [local YMCA](https://www.daytonymca.org/locations/ymca-heights).
  * I don't have a  number for this - I need to do more thinking and research.
* Run:
    * a 5k non-stop.
    * a 5k in less than 30 minutes.
    * non-stop for 30 consistently.
  * I was able to run a 5k non-stop last year, and I ran it under 30 minutes. But just once.
  * I would like to do this more consistently.

## Improve Personally & Professionally

* Finish at least one book a month.
* Attend at least one conference or other networking event.
* Donate blood as much as possible.
  * In 2024 I donated six times, bringing my total donations to 15.
  * I have to wait at least four weeks between appointments; I'm eligible to donate now, but I've been feeling a bit under the weather.

## Focus on Family

* Read to the kids everyday.
* Hike as a family at least sixteen times.
* Seven or more date nights.
* Eat out no more than once a week as a family.

So there you have it. Is there anything you'd suggest I add? Do you have any goals for this year?
