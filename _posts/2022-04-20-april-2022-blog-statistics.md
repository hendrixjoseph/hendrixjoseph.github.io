Spring is here and it's the 20th. Time for another Blog Stat report.

I made four posts in the past month:

* [A Eulogy for Princess](https://www.joehxblog.com/a-eulogy-for-princess/)
* [March 2022 Book Reading List](https://www.joehxblog.com/march-2022-book-reading-list/)
* [An Elephant Cake for My Son's Birthday](https://www.joehxblog.com/an-elephant-cake-for-my-sons-birthday/)
* [Free File Fillable Forms Federal Tax Return XML Error X0000-005 (Again!)](https://www.joehxblog.com/free-file-fillable-forms-federal-tax-return-xml-error-x0000-005-again/)

Since Alexa is going away starting the first of May (which is next month), this will be the last time I'm able to report my Alexa rank.

Unless the Alexa people change their mind at the last minute.
