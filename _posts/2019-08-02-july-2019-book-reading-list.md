This July 2019 book reading list marks my eighteenth book reading list.

I continue to read to my son. He's getting more interested when I read to him - he's a lot more interactive.

For instance, here's him playing with a slider in one of his books:

*My son playing with a slider in a book as he sits on my lap.*

Our normal reading time to him is after dinner (sometimes while he's still eating).  And he *pays attention* now. Just look at him paying attention (and ignore my big old bald spot):

*Reading a book to my son after dinner.*

He's come to expect a book after dinner. He'll point to the bookshelf behind the high chair expecting us to choose a book. Once he's out of the high chair, he wants to get the book we just read to him.

It's so cute!

## The Book I Read for Me

I haven't finished a book per se.... The "book" I'm reading has a long title on Amazon. Namely, it's [99 Classic Science-Fiction Short Stories: Works by Philip K. Dick, Ray Bradbury, Isaac Asimov, H.G. Wells, Edgar Allan Poe, Seabury Quinn, Jack London...and many more! (99 Readym Anthologies Book 2)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RKSDTFP/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20).

Yeah, they're going for that title SEO with all them author keywords.

The Amazon page says there are 1,821 pages. I started reading it towards the end of June. No wonder I haven't finished it yet!

Right now, the price is set at $4.99 (it might be different by the time you read it). I got it for free because I'm subscribed to one of [these free ebook subreddits](https://old.reddit.com/r/FreeEBOOKS+KindleFreebies/).

At the time I got it (May 6, 2019), it was free for everyone on Amazon. The authors (or, in this case, publishers) will post on those subreddits when they make their ebooks free. I highly suggest you subscribe.

Of the "99 Classic Science-Fiction Short Stories" I've finished the following:

1. *The People of the Pit* by Abraham Merritt
2. *Omega Anthony* by Amelia Reynolds Long
3. *Ooze* by Melville Rud
4. *The Nth Power* by Arthur Train
5. *The Black Abbot of Puthuum* by Clark Ashton Smith
6. *The Jelly- Fish* by David H. Keller
7. *The Rat Racket* by David H. Keller
8. *The Worm Donald* by David H. Keller
9. *Storm Warning* by Allen Wollheim
10. *The Machine Stops* by E.M. Forster
11. *A Descent into the Maelstrom* by Edgar Allan Poe
12. *A Tale of the Ragged Mountains* by Edgar Allan Poe
13. *MS. Found in a Bottle* by Edgar Allan Poe
14. *Mellonta Tauta* by Edgar Allan Poe
15. *Mesmeric Revelation* by Edgar Allan Poe
16. *Some Words with a Mummy* by Edgar Allan Poe
17. *The Balloon Hoax* by Edgar Allan Poe
18. *The Colloquy of Monos and Una* by Edgar Allan Poe
19. *The Conversation of Eiros and Charmion* by Edgar Allan Poe

It's true that many of these, as [this review suggests](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2T9RXEXZ067U/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) aren't really science fiction. There just old enough to be public domain that someone could easily make an ebook and put it up on Amazon.

Well, that's it for July. Until next month!

What did you read this month?
