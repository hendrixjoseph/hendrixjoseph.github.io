This month marks the 18th monthly blog statistic report I've made in a row. I feel as if my numbers tend to be going in a general upward trend. Unsure if that's because I've been paying attention to those numbers or not.

Anyway, here's June's numbers:

I was able to publish five posts this month:

* [Eight Common Debts That You Don't Normally Think of As Debt ]({{ site.url }}/eight-common-debts-that-you-dont-normally-think-of-as-debt/)
* [Turn a Stream of Arrays to Single Stream in Java]({{ site.url }}/turn-a-stream-of-arrays-to-single-stream-in-java/)
* [May 2019 Book Reading List]({{ site.url }}/may-2019-book-reading-list/)
* [Five Ways to Loop Through An Array in Java]({{ site.url }}/five-ways-to-loop-through-an-array-in-java/)
* [Kroger Pay Review]({{ site.url }}/kroger-pay-review/)

I also had one guest post/syndicated post:

* [What You Need to Know about Fundrise and DiversyFund]({{ site.url }}/what-you-need-to-know-about-fundrise-and-diversyfund/)
