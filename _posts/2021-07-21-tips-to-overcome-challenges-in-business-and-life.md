Every now and then, we all come across challenges at different stages and times in our lives. Challenges are meant to shape us for good and serve as a stepping stone for us to reach a greater height.

Great men and women are great because they overcome challenges and never run away from them; they see challenges as exciting and face them enthusiastically.

In business, the same rules apply. Challenges come up that need to be overcome.

Here are general rules to overcome challenges in business [and in life](https://adimesaved.com/best-frugal-living-tips).

## 1. Identify Your Challenge

It is important to identify your challenges to understand the problem's root better and develop a more robust solution.

Challenges can be internal or external; they could take shape as people, issues, or organizations. Identifying these challenges, also known as obstacles, will allow you to find their root cause and remove them or work around them.

The most common business challenges are:

* Change management - dealing with resistance from employees who don't want change
* Failing to set achievable goals and deliver on them

## 2. Develop a plan of action

It's important to know that your work is not in vain and your efforts won't be wasted. There are some steps, which will help you overcome the challenges in this industry.

In order to succeed in any goal or overcome any challenge, you need to have a clear plan of action.  Plan first and then act. Sit down and develop exactly what you need to do and how you will do it. Taking time and effort to develop a plan is worth more than any amount of random actions. You can work hard, [or you can work smart](https://yourmoneygeek.com/passive-income/). Working smart is only possible if you have a clear plan in place. Although plans are essential to success, don't forget that any good plan will have room for adjustment and have space to pivot and change as you learn. Adjust your plan when you discover new information and if you see that your plan is not successful. Flexibility is also an important part of any plan.

## 3. Work On Yourself

All challenges are inside. The solution to every problem is within, and so is the cause. You can only control your actions, and you cannot control anyone else. See what you can do to fix the situation and overcome the challenge. When you focus on what you can accomplish and no one else, then you will be successful.

You need to work on yourself to get out of the challenges you are facing. What you do in your personal life is what you do in your professional life. The way you feel and interact with others affects how they will treat you and how they will treat themselves.

## 4. Know The Facts

You should study, analyze and understand the true nature of the challenge; what it demands. You will then write down your findings. This action alone quickly puts you in charge. It puts you in action, and the challenge, in inaction. It dilutes the venom in the challenge and concentrates the drive in you.

Knowing the facts of your challenge is important for solving it. If you're going to solve a problem, you have to understand what the issue is. You need to know the facts of your challenge. You need to know what is happening and why it's happening. So sit down with a pen and paper and as impartially as you can- write down the facts and know them.

## 5. Don’t Be A Coward

You should never attempt to run away from the challenge, as, just like a wild dog, it would run straight after you and approach you with vicious intentions. You are born a champion. Only cowards run away from challenges.

In the modern world, we all know that we have to be tough. As a matter of fact, the world is not going to give you anything. So you have to go out there and take it. However, in order to make sure that you are ready for the challenge ahead of you and that you will succeed in life, you must always be prepared emotionally for the challenges that face you.

## 6. See The Benefits

You should try never curse the challenge, as every challenge, upon victory, hands you several benefits of equivalent magnitude. Challenges come to strengthen. This you must acknowledge. Great storms make oaks take deeper roots.

Challenges are often thought of as negatives. But challenges come with a lot of benefits for those who can overcome them. Challenges often make us stronger and can help us find our true potential. Challenges come to strengthen and provide an opportunity for success.

## 7. No Blame Game

You should never blame anyone, your peers, the teachers, your parents, the school, the government, or your God for the challenges. So complaining, blaming is not the method of winners.

When you find yourself in a tough situation, the first thing that you need to do is to stop blaming others. The path of the conqueror is never strewn with roses, and often there are many challenges. Do not let your mind be a prisoner of your past, even if it was negative.

## 8. Be Responsible

You should take total responsibility for every challenge and outcome of every contest you pursue in life. You must arrive with conviction and passion. Only as you stand on your feet can you grow in stature.

In order to make a difference, one should take responsibility for their own decisions. This includes taking responsibility for the problems they face in their life. Problems might feel like they are too big or overwhelming, but there is always a way to solve them. Remember that it’s never too late to [start moving in a direction you want your life to go in](https://adimesaved.com/what-no-money-can-buy), even if it feels like you are going against everything that is happening around you.

## 9. Don’t Set Yourself Up

You should never cry, blame yourself, pity yourself or say "why me?" as you confront the challenge, for this will serve to suspend the thinking process necessary to overcome the challenge.

To overcome any challenge, you must be able to think clearly. By blaming yourself, feeling sorry for yourself, or asking "why me?" you cannot think rationally and work through the problem. This is because your thoughts are clouded by emotion, which means you cannot develop a solution.

## 10. Read

Knowledge is light. It’s a great idea to contact the library or bookshop to get books written by practical men and women, who have had similar challenges, to learn how they won. [You should read such books](https://adimesaved.com/best-books-for-women-by-women) and profit from their wisdom and then win over your own challenge.

It is important to be open-minded, learn from what other people have gone through, and share their success stories. Knowledge is light. It has helped me cope with my challenges in life; it can help you too.

## 11. Never Walk Alone

To go far, seek out peers. You need other people, just as they need you. So find someone who is facing a similar challenge to yours and work hard to help them overcome it. In doing so, you may just solve your own problem by hearing their solution.

The greatest asset you have is your peers. They are the people who can help you see your situation from a different perspective, who can offer new solutions, and who will be able to understand and empathize with you. Suppose you find someone facing the same challenge as yours, work hard to help them overcome it. In doing so, you may just be helping yourself overcome it as well.

## 12. Find A Mentor

Mentors are the people who have been there before; they have experienced what you are going through or rather been in situations similar to yours.
You need to find a mentor, an experienced and trusted friend, and an adviser. You shall table the substance of your challenge before them and humbly request guidance. Your teachers and parents will qualify for this role. Even though well-meaning and loving, your friends or classmates, because of their meager experience, shall not qualify.

If you are already a parent or out of school, an expert in the very field that brings forth the challenge shall constitute a credible mentor. Friends, in-laws, and neighbors, except they be broadly experienced, will be unfit to mentor.

## 13. Keep On Keeping-On

When it rains, it pours: by this, you shall realize that challenges, like blessings, often arrive in multiples; they march with siblings. You should take heart and never give up, even in the face of the toughest tribulation. You should appreciate that just as the night is darkest shortly before dawn, difficulties often attain their hardest bite at the brink of their decline, only needing a little extra persistence from you to unveil the multiple blessings they always hide. This blessing shall ultimately become yours as a fair reward for your faith and perseverance. You shall remember that there is always a solution, no matter the magnitude of the problem. You should, therefore, always persist until you achieve.
