Part of my 2020 goal to [improve my health](https://www.joehxblog.com/2020-new-years-resolutions-goals/#improve-our-health) was to weigh less than 225 pounds.

The bad news is I probably won't weigh less than 225 pounds by the end of the year. The good news is that I'm awfully close.

I started the year at 245 pounds. Come July 4th, I was at 251.2 pounds. This morning, on December the 28th, I weighed 228.6 pounds.

What was the source of my change halfway through the year? In addition to tracking my food on [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), I began running. Initially, I was only running three days a week - Monday, Wednesday, and Friday - but at some point, I upped that to five days a week. Every day except for the weekend.

On the weekends, my wife and I try to go on a hike with our two little ones. And, during the week, in addition to my run, my wife and I walk our dogs around the block at lunchtime.

Overall, according to the [stats on MapMyFitness](https://www.mapmyfitness.com/workout/stats), I've exercised (walked, ran, & hiked) a total of 444.72 miles over 6.6 days (that's 158 hours and 24 minutes - assuming no rounding!) and burned 83,968 Calories (that is, kilocalories, or just 83.968 plain ol' lowercase-c calories) over a total of 256 workouts.

If we just look at the stats for my runs, then I ran 291.44 miles over 85 hours, 1 minute, and 33 seconds, burning 42,346 Calories over 101
runs.

So I'm not upset that I won't weigh less than my goal of 225 pounds by the end of the year. I'm sure I can get those last few pounds off in the next year.

My thought is, now that I seem to be at an acceptable weight - what should my next health goals be? Better runs? What else can I measure?

## Additional Charts

*Chart of my weight in pounds over the past 180 days.*

![Average Pace in minutes per mile.](/images/fitness-2020/average-pace.png)
*Average Pace in minutes per mile. The trendline shows a decrease in pace, which means an increase in speed (which is good).*

![Distance ran per run, in miles.](/images/fitness-2020/distance.png)
*Distance ran per run, in miles. How far I ran on each run. The trendline shows I'm going farther than when I started. The dips are those runs where I had errands to run and so didn't have enough time to run as much.*

![Number of runs per month.](/images/fitness-2020/runs-per-month.png)
*Number of runs per month. The trendline shows I'm running more each month than when I started. December isn't over, so I should have more runs this month.*

![Number of runs per week.](/images/fitness-2020/runs-per-week.png)
*Number of runs per week. Again, the trendline shows I'm running more than when I started.*
