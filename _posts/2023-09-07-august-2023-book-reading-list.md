## The Books I Read for Me

I read two books - and, since I've been alternating between fiction and nonfiction - one was fiction on was nonfiction.

The fiction book was [And Another Thing... by Eoin Colfer](https://www.amazon.com/Another-Thing-Hitchhikers-Guide-Galaxy-ebook/dp/B002WGC8PU/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). This is the sixth (and final) book in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series. You'll notice it wasn't written by Douglas Adams - it was written after his death. It is, however, the "official" sixth book.

The nonfiction books was [Raising Good Humans: a Mindful Guide to Breaking the Cycle of Reactive Parenting and Raising Kind, Confident Kids](https://www.amazon.com/Raising-Good-Humans-Parenting-Confident/dp/1684033888/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). I'm always striving to be a better parent to my kids.
