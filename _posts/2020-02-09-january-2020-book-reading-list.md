I've been incredibly busy with the newborn (now six weeks old) and the oldborn (almost two years old!) that I've barely had time to keep up with this blog.

I am still doing my standard posts - [blog stats posts](https://www.joehxblog.com/tags/#blog-statistics), [beginning-of-year goal posts](https://www.joehxblog.com/tags/#goals), and, yes, these monthly book reading lists.

## Books I Read to My Son

I read eighteen or nineteen different books to my son:

It's "eighteen or nineteen" difference books because "Five Little Monkeys Jumping on the Bed" is repeated twice above. That's because we have two copies of the same book. Well, it's nearly the same book - they have the same title, same author, same text, but different illustrations.

Oh, and my son really likes the song. Heck, he likes songs in general. We have a Google Home, and if it's not playing songs, he asks for a song.

His favorite songs are *Five Little Monkeys Jumping on the Bed*, *Old McDonald had a Farm*, *If You're Happy and You Know It*, and *Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes*.

He also has an Elmo (or, as he pronounces it, "Melmo") obsession.

Combining songs and Elmo (a natural for anything Sesame Street) he especially likes the following YouTube video:

## Books I Read to My Daughter

My son usurps my reading-to time, but I was able to manage reading two different books to my daughter:

* [Baby Animals](https://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/2462910/77416/2029?u=https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9780312498580/30290639210)
* First Words

## The Books I Read for Me

I bought [Star Trek: Picardâ€”Countdown #1 (of 3)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WV6WYKB/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) using my [Amazon Prime No-Rush Shipping Credits](https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=9433645011&tag=hendrixjoseph-20).

I've been watching [Star Trek Picard](https://www.amazon.com/Star-Trek-Picard-Teaser/dp/B07S7ZF57X/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) on [CBS All Access](https://www.cbs.com/all-access/), so I wanted a bit of the backstory of the show.

I've also been reading [Business Adventures: Twelve Classic Tales from the World of Wall Street](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L1TPCKW/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) which I got for "free" via [Prime Reading](https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/fd/nonprime-pr/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20).

I'm on the twelfth and final story - which also happens to be the longest. Each story is placed (and, from the sound of the narration, written) sometime in the 1950s or 1960s.

Despite the impression that "wall street stories" sound as if they should be a bit boring, I've found each of the stories interesting and a pleasant read.

If anyone is curious about what the stories are, their titles are as follows:

1. The Fluctuation
2. The Fate of the Edsel
3. The Federal Income Tax
4. A Reasonable Amount of Time
5. Xerox Xerox Xerox Xerox
6. Making the Customers Whole
7. The Impacted Philosophers
8. The Last Great Corner
9. A Second Sort of Life
10. Stockholder Season
11. One Free Bite
12. In Defense of Sterling

That's it for this month. Here's to hoping I can write regularly again soon!
