Mostly for fun, I run a Facebook Page called [Puppy Snuggles](https://www.facebook.com/puppysnuggle/) - which is the page for my [dog blog](https://www.puppy-snuggles.com/) of the same name. But just because I run it for fun, doesn't mean I don't want page likes.

I've experimented a bit with [boosting Facebook posts](https://www.joehxblog.com/case-study-facebook-boost-post/) and have had some success with that - it seems the key is to target your audience - but I wanted to try something free.

So, a little less than a month ago, I decided I might try sharing some of my page's dog content onto dog groups - specifically, dog groups I do not own.

Most of the content I post on the Puppy Snuggles Facebook page is shares of dog-related content from other pages. I can't share those posts to groups and have it attributed to Puppy Snuggles - it will just look as if I shared it to the group directly from the original page.

I do, however, have [a decent amount of dog photos and memes](https://www.facebook.com/pg/puppysnuggle/photos/) that are stored directly on my page. I decided to share some of those photos.

Keep in mind, I don't want to spam these dog groups - I want to share engaging content. No t-shirt spam.

So, for the past month, almost daily, sometimes more than once a day, I'll find a cute picture stored on the photo section of my page, and share it to some dog groups I'm a part of.

> How do I know that the members of the groups do not already "like" my page? Well, my page has 731 likes as I write this. Some of the groups have tens of thousands of members. Thanks to the [Pigeonhole Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle), I know that they can't all like my page already!

## So What Has Happened With My Page This Past Month?

I've gone from 717 likes on October 11, 2019, to 731 likes today, November 11, 2019. That's a net increase of 14 likes.

To compare, I only had 717 likes on September 11, 2019. That's right - a net change of zero likes in the prior month.

## Conclusion

Is sharing to groups worth a net increase of 14 likes?

Probably not for most people - there's probably more effective ways to get Facebook likes for your page.

Is it worth it just for the fun factor?

Absolutely.
