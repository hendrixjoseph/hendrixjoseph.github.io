title: GameStop Gift Card Invalid? Here's What Worked for Me
tags: [video games]
---

I had some old GameStop gift cards that when I tried to use them... They just didn't work.

I was afraid that maybe they'd been hacked, but they didn't even show a zero balance. The number was just "invalid."

I tried going to a physical store, but the employees couldn't help me. I tried calling the number on the back of the gift card, but all I could access was an automated line that told me the gift card number was invalid.

Finally, I found a different 800 number on [GameStop's Contact Us page](https://www.gamestop.com/contact/). I called that number and talked to a real, live human. That real, live human was super helpful and, just by the gift card number alone (she didn't need the access code) was able to find the balance.

A week later I received the balance on a new gift card via email. I had recovered the GameStop gift card balance.

I printed the email, took that printout along with my son to GameStop, and let him choose a game.

The game he chose? [Princess Peach: Showtime!](https://www.amazon.com/Princess-PeachTM-Showtime-Version-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0CJ3CKLRH/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) Why? Because he thought his younger sister would enjoy it.

Here's the timeline it took me to recover the gift card:

* Visited the physical store on October 12, 2024 and tried to use the old gift cards.
* Called the 800-number on October 17, 2024.
* Received new gift card via email October 21, 2024.
* Visited the same physical store again on November 16, 2024.

And here's a couple Reddit threads that helped me figure out what to do:
