Time flies. May is over and it's now June.

## The Books I Read for Me

Continuing with the [Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09C37PHLS?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) books series I read [So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish](https://www.amazon.com/Long-Thanks-Hitchhikers-Guide-Galaxy-ebook/dp/B001OF5F1E?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). Probably the best one since the first one.

I also read [Lies My Teacher Told Me](https://www.amazon.com/Lies-My-Teacher-Told-Everything/dp/1620973928/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). Based on the title, I expected it to have a conservative slant, but it was quite the opposite.
