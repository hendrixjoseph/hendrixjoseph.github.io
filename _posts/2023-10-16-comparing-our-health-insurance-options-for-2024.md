title: Comparing Our Health Insurance Options for 2024
tags: [health, math]

It's open enrollment season, which means it's time for my wife and I to select our health insurance for next year.

As complicated as health insurance is - dealing with deductibles, out-pocket-maximums, in-network-vs-out-of-network doctors, and so on - the way I compare plans is simple. I add the out-of-pocket max (OOP) to the total premiums for the year. I then choose the cheapest option.

For instance, next year we have three options: a $350-deductible plan with a $4,000 OOP and a $510.45 premium, an $850-deductible plan with a $4,800 OOP and a $387.61 premium, and a $2,500-deductible plan with a $214.26 premium.

Now, the plan paperwork never explicitly stated it, but the premiums are per-check. The OOP are annual. Since there's 26 checks a year, I need to multiply each premium by 26 before I get my comparison value.

deductible | OOP | premium | premium Ã— 26 | OOP + premium
---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---:
$350 | $4,000  | $510.45 | $13,271.70  | $17,271.70
$800 | $4,800  | $387.61 | $10,077.86  | $14,877.86
$2,500 | $6,850  | $214.26 | $5,570.76  | $12,420.76

The clear winner here is the $2,500-deductible option. As an added bonus, it's the only one that's HSA eligible.

I know there's a few flaws with my comparison. The premium affects my tax rate. The deductible affects how fast - and potentially how much - I will spend out-of-pocket. But it works for what my wife and I need.
