And it's not that it's going to take over everyone's job.

That threat is bad, true. AI is definitely going to upset and transform the job market. But that's not where the danger lies.

The true danger of artificial intelligence?

People think that ChatGPT can write an entire program for them? Sure - but do you really think that the data it was trained on *had no bugs or security vulnerabilities?*

Those companies that manage to use AI right? Those companies will excel.

The hard part will be telling which company from which.
