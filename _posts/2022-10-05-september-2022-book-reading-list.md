Consistency. That's why I've been making these *book reading list* posts for almost five years.

*Five years*. Since *2018*. Wow.

I read 20 different books to my son - and 18 different books to my daughter.

I only managed to read one book for myself. I would've finished another, but I fell ill towards the end of the month.

## The Books I Read for Me

Finally, I read [Atlantis and Other Places by Harry Turtledove](https://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/2462910/77416/2029?u=https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?tn=Atlantis and Other Places by Harry Turtledove). It's a collection of stories by the award-winning alternate history writer [Harry Turtledove](https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Turtledove/e/B000APWWZQ?tag=hendrixjoseph-20).

Two involve the what-if a landmass exists in the Atlantic, broken off from North America much like New Zealand broke off from Australia.
