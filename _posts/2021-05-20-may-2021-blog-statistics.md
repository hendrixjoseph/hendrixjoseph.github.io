For the forty-first time, it's the twentieth. Well, actually it's probably the gazillionth time it's the twentieth - but this is my 41st blog stats post.

That's right, I've been consistently doing these posts since [January 2018](https://www.joehxblog.com/january-2018-blog-statistics/).

I'm starting to write more again with four posts written this month:

* [My Exercise Routine](https://www.joehxblog.com/my-exercise-routine/)
* [I Want to Want Something](https://www.joehxblog.com/i-want-to-want-something/)
* [April 2021 Book Reading List](https://www.joehxblog.com/april-2021-book-reading-list/)
* [Sometimes The Unit is Not the Unit](https://www.joehxblog.com/the-unit-is-not-the-unit/)

The most posts I've ever written in a month were in [July 2019](https://www.joehxblog.com/july-2019-blog-statistics/) and [September 2019](https://www.joehxblog.com/september-2019-blog-statistics/) with eight posts in each month. I was really hustling back then.

On [my campaign site](https://joe4huberheights.com), I also wrote four posts:

* [Campaign Strategy Overview - My Facebook Strategy](https://www.joe4huberheights.com/my-facebook-strategy/) posted on May 19, 2021
* [Campaign Strategy Overview - Choosing This Website](https://www.joe4huberheights.com/choosing-this-website/) posted on May 10, 2021
* [2021 Huber Heights Ward 3 Primary Results](https://www.joe4huberheights.com/2021-huber-heights-primary-results/) posted on May 5, 2021
* [Make Huber Heights City Emails Publicly Available](https://www.joe4huberheights.com/make-huber-heights-city-emails-publicly-available/) posted on April 29, 2021

Not-so-fun, sad fact: I didn't make it past the primary. Oh well, that frees me up for the rest of the year.

## Alexa

My Alexa rank slipped another 100,000 points, but I'm still under a million:

* Global Rank &rarr; 1,843,741

## Google Analytics

However, my Google Analytics shows that I have consistant views:

* Sessions &rarr; 6,545
* Users &rarr; 5,805
* Pageviews &rarr; 8,059

## AdSense

AdSense is awesome - I'm once again above the threshold of $100. Let's see if my account gets limited again when they pay me.

Here are my AdSense stats for this month:

* Balance &rarr; $140.96
* Estimated earnings &rarr; $113.23
* Impressions &rarr; 19,465
* Clicks &rarr; 191

## Moz Stats

My Moz Domain Authority dropped by one, but my linking domains increased by five:

Moz Domain Authority &rarr; 31
Moz Linking Domains &rarr; 505

## Ratios

* Earnings / 1,000 sessions = $113.23 / 6.545 = $17.30
* Earnings / 1,000 pageviews = $113.23 / 8.059 = $14.05
* Earnings / 1,000 impressions = $113.23 / 19.465 = $5.82
* Earnings / day = $113.23 / 30 = $3.77
* Sessions / day = 6,545 / 30 = 218.2
* Pageviews / day = 8,059 / 30 = 268.6
* Impressions / day = 19,465 / 30 = 648.83
