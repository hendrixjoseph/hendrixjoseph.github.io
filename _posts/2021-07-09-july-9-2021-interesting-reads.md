## The Rules

Here are the rules for what articles I choose to include in this weekly roundup:

1. It can't be anything I wrote.
2. It has to be something I actually read. Nothing that simply had an interesting headline.
3. I have to have read it since the previous post. It does not have to be something that was written in the past week.
4. It has to be something I read online. In other words, it has to be a webpage with a URL.

## The Reads

[Visa is partnering with over 50 crypto companies to allow clients to spend and convert digital currencies](https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/cryptocurreny-payments-visa-partnership-clients-spend-convert-digital-currencies-2021-7) - basically making it as easy to spend crypto as it is to use a debit or credit card. I didn't see a list of those 50 companies on the article, but I do know that BlockFi, [Coinbase](https://www.joehxblog.com/coinbase/), and [Uphold](https://www.joehxblog.com/uphold/) all have (or will soon have) some sort of credit or debit card.

This article was just fun: [How Nintendo introduced the Game Boy, Tetris, and Pok√©mon to the West](https://www.polygon.com/2019/4/19/18295061/game-boy-history-timeline-tetris-pokemon-nintendo). I remember getting my Game Boy for Christmas way back in the early nineties. There's even a video of how excited I was - I should find that video and post it!

We went on a rather long road trip with our little ones a couple of weeks back. This [Family Road Trip Hacks](https://www.5minutesformom.com/151852/family-road-trip-hacks) article would have been a good read. It still is, but it would have been, too.

Hospitals are now required to post their prices online. NPR has an article [Hospitals Have Started Posting Their Prices Online. Here's What They Reveal](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/07/02/1012317032/hospitals-have-started-posting-their-prices-online-heres-what-they-reveal). My local paper also has an article - [Hospital charges posted online, but hard to use](https://www.daytondailynews.com/business/hospital-charges-posted-online-but-hard-use/i9gfn7gsWKk58XJNglj6KP/). I've looked at a couple of the local hospital's price listings and, yeah, they're pretty cryptic.

More and more car companies are moving to electric - [Jeep reveals two-row Grand Cherokee 4xe, promises full EV lineup by 2025](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/jeep-ev-full-line-2025-grand-cherokee-4xe/). I guess "4xe" means four-wheel-drive electric? And, oddly enough, Jeep (or Chrystler) doesn't own the 4xe trademark - [someone else does](https://trademark.trademarkia.com/4xe-88679221.html).

Check out the Jeep electric promo video - it's got some interesting concepts that are yet to be implemented:
