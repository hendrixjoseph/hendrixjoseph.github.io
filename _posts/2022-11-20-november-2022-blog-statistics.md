Time again to report on my blog status.

Three. That's the number of posts I've made in the past month.

Two were written by me:

* [My Experiment with Tax Loss Harvesting Microsoft - Part 1](https://www.joehxblog.com/my-experiment-with-tax-loss-harvesting-microsoft-part-1/)
* [October 2022 Book Reading List](https://www.joehxblog.com/october-2022-book-reading-list/)

And one was a paid guest post:

* [How to Afford a New Honda in 2023](https://www.joehxblog.com/how-to-afford-a-new-honda-in-2023/)
