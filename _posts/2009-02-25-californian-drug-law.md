We all know that cigarettes and alcohol can be expensive because states will tax the hell out of time. Currently, California has virtually no money, and one politician has come up with a solution: tax recreational marijuana.

My initial response was: How the hell are they going to tax something that is illegal? Marijuana is a schedule 1 controlled substance by the Federal Government. Federal Government, of course, trumps state or local government.

I actually think it's a great idea. Making drugs such as illegal has only caused problems. The opportunity costs in tax dollars are too great. Mexico is currently in the midst of civil war: the Mexican government versus the drug cartels. This Mexican Civil War is beginning to bulge into Texas and will eventually burst. If drugs weren't illegal, these drug lords would have no power.
