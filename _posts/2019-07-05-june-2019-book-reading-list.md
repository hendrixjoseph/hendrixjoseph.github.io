2019 is half over. It's time for my *seventeenth* book reading list.

It's hard to believe I've been able to be consistent with these for so long.

## Books I Read to My Son

Not only is my son now paying attention to books when I read them to him, his picking up books and bringing them to me so I can read them to him! He actually does this more with my wife than me.

She's absolutely thrilled that he's doing this.

Here are the books I read to him in June 2019:

* [Panda Bear Panda Bear What Do You See?](https://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/2462910/77416/2029?u=https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9780805017588)

## The Books I Read for Me

One book I read via [Amazon's Prime Reading program](https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/hz/bookshelf/prime/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20):

* [2600 Phrases for Effective Performance Reviews](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I8WHMY/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20)

And one book I read when the author gave the ebook away on [Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/FreeEBOOKS+KindleFreebies/):

* [Solar Power Demystified: The Beginners Guide To Solar Power, Energy Independence And Lower Bills](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QNC25CP/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20)

I mostly skimmed through [2600 Phrases for Effective Performance Reviews](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I8WHMY/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). I thought it might be helpful for doing self-reviews at work, but I'm not too sure.

[Solar Power Demystified: The Beginners Guide To Solar Power, Energy Independence And Lower Bills](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QNC25CP/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) was okay... I guess. It felt as if English was not the author's first language, and felt more like it was advertising their websites than providing information.

That's it for June. What have you been reading?
