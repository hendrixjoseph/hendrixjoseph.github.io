It's been a heck of a year so far. It's the twelfth and I haven't even published a post yet!

The reason being this thing that happened at the end of last year:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">December 28th, 2019. 5:16am. 10 lbs 4 oz and 22 inches. Twitter, meet my daughter, Wendy Ann Hendrix. <a href="https://t.co/XWvAoKqsq0">pic.twitter.com/XWvAoKqsq0</a></p>&mdash; Joseph Hendrix (@JoeHxBlog) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeHxBlog/status/1211377937238364162?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 29, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Hopefully starting next month I'll have a section called "Books I Read to My Daughter." For now, I just have my two regular sections:

## Books I Read to My Son

I read to my son eleven different books in December:

* [A Charlie Brown Christmas](https://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/2462910/77416/2029?u=https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9780762451456/30188181959)

* [Sesame Street Big Enough for a Bed](https://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/2462910/77416/2029?u=https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9780375822704/30077277178)
* [The 12 Dogs of Christmas](https://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/2462910/77416/2029?u=https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9780849979392/30536559916)
* [The Christmas Gingerbread Man](https://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/2462910/77416/2029?u=https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9781576573808/30463090871)

Of course, Christmas being in December, he had quite a few Christmas books read to him.

He's also learning to count. Right now he can count to six (although he skips two). I don't think he quite understands what counting *is*, he just likes to repeat the pattern.

## The Books I Read for Me

I read two books for me.

The first was [Android Development for Gifted Primates: A Beginner's Guide](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FYSKVYY/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). Last year I had [a goal to publish an Android App](https://www.joehxblog.com/2019-new-years-resolutions-goals/). I never made that goal, but I have been working towards it. This book, while outdated (then again, any book on computers is outdated by the time it is published), did help me in a few places I got stuck.

The other book I read was [Hacking for Beginners: Step By Step Guide to Cracking Codes Discipline, Penetration Testing, and Computer Virus. Learning Basic Security Tools On How To Ethical Hack And Grow](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZFFHXXD/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). Despite its name, it more provided an overview of hacking techniques (e.g. SQL injection, XSS scripting) rather than how to do those techniques. Also, I felt as if the book was translated from another language (perhaps German) via software. There were a few spots that the word didn't seem to get translated.

Despite being busy with the new baby, I am still getting some reading in.

Until next month!
