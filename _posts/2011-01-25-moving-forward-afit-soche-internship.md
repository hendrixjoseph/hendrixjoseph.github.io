This is just awesome. I got an internship at [SOCHE - the Southwest Ohio Council for Higher Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_Ohio_Council_for_Higher_Education). I will actually be working at the [Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_Institute_of_Technology) on [Wright-Patterson Air Force Base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WPAFB).
