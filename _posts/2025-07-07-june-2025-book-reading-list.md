## The Book I Read for Me

I read [AgeProof](https://www.amazon.com/AgeProof-Living-Without-Running-Breaking-ebook/dp/B01HZFB65A/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) and [Daniels' Running Formula](https://www.amazon.com/Daniels-Running-Formula-Jack-ebook/dp/B08QCDSFVN/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). I was hoping AgeProof would provide me with more health concepts that I didn't already know; that said, it was an enjoyable read. I'm not sure how actionable *Daniels' Running Formula* was for me - maybe if I wanted to use the training plans, it would be. Instead, I've bought a [heart rate monitor](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088RMK1GX/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) to use on my runs, and started using [Runalyze](https://runalyze.com/) and [CityStrides](https://www.joehxblog.com/citystrides/) to get deeper insights into my runs.

I also read books 35 and 36 of the *Magic Tree House* series:

<ol start="35">
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Camp+Time+in+California&i=stripbooks&tag=hendrixjoseph-20">Camp Time in California</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Sunlight+on+the+Snow+Leopard&i=stripbooks&tag=hendrixjoseph-20">Sunlight on the Snow Leopard</a></li>
</ol>

My son has finished the *Magic Tree House* series (except for [#4o, Sea Otter Sunrise](https://www.amazon.com/Otter-Sunrise-Magic-Tree-House/dp/059370651X/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) which was just published on July 1st - and he's super excited about!) and has moved on to [The Boxcar Children](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=The+Boxcar+Children&i=stripbooks&tag=hendrixjoseph-20) and . He's asked me to read *The Boxcar Children* next!.
