It's been quite a journey since my son first asked for [an elephant cake for his 4th birthday](https://www.joehxblog.com/an-elephant-cake-for-my-sons-birthday/).

This year, for his sixth birthday, he asked for a Mario cake. As in Super Mario, the Nintendo-owned plumber protagonist.

I'm no cake boss, so I'm able to make anything super complex. After a bit of searching on the Internet, a found [this guide on how to make a Super Mario cake](https://www.meetpenny.com/how-to-make-a-super-mario-cake/).

My cake didn't end up looking as good. Compare the cake from the above link (go ahead, click on it, then come back) to my final result:

The biggest difference is I just used regular icing - [Pillsbury white icing](https://www.amazon.com/Pillsbury-Creamy-Supreme-Classic-Frosting/dp/B06VW4QHDZ/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) died red for the hat and [Pillsbury buttercream icing](https://www.amazon.com/Pillsbury-Creamy-Supreme-Buttercream-Frosting/dp/B01N0IL8Z0/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) for the off-white skin tone - instead of some sort of fancy "marshmallow fondant."

I did *try* to make a small batch of marshmallow fondant, but it didn't turn out. Probably because the marshmallows were a bit stale, and I used regular, granulated sugar rather than powdered sugar.

My wife was out bowling with her moms group while I was making it, so I texted her updates on the process. I'm not going to share the texts themselves, but here's the progress pics I made:

So, yeah, I think the cake looks a bit off. Mario's nose is quite the honker, his eyes are a bit wonkey, and I can't quite tell if his mustache looks more like his smile. But, hey, my kid liked it. That's what counts, right?
