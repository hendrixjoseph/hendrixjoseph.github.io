February was a heck of a month reading-wise.

My son continues enjoying being read to - and looking at books himself, as well. We started taking him to [Mother Goose on the Loose](https://mgol.net/) at the library on Saturday mornings. It's basically a few nursery rhymes along with a story. He absolutely loves it - the smile on his face is worth the half hour it lasts.

A number of the books I'll mention below came from the library. My son likes Sesame Street - especially Elmo - and animals right now.

My daughter just turned two months. I try to read to her, and often when I do it's a children's book that happens to be in arms reach while I'm holding her. *She doesn't like to be set down - she much prefers to be held.*

A few times when I start reading to my daughter, my son wants to join in. That's why you see below that I read [Baby! Talk!](https://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/2462910/77416/2029?u=https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9780517800799/30336399578) to both my son a daughter - I read it to them at the same time.

## Books I Read to My Daughter

I read five different books to my daughter:

* [Baby Goofy Catches a Fish](https://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/2462910/77416/2029?u=https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9789999030052/22883584519)

## The Books I Read for Me

I finished the last chapter (or is it tale?) in the book I was reading - [Business Adventures: Twelve Classic Tales from the World of Wall Street](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L1TPCKW/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). The last tale - called "In Defense of Sterling" - was about how the world banks rallied to keep the British Pound from losing value. This story took place sometime in the 60s - the decade before the [decimalisation of the pound sterling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling#Decimalisation).

My initial plan was to alternate between fiction and nonfiction books. However, the past few books I've read were straight-up nonfiction, so I decided I needed to read a few fiction books to keep up.

The books I read were [Screen by Aarti Patel](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KHKZQM0/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) and [Caught in Time by Howard Berenbon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079B81FJX/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20).

I won't go into too much detail about what each book is about (click on their links and visit the Amazon site to read their description) but I will say both are science-fiction books. *Screen* is more a dystopian type, whereas *Caught in Time* is a time-travel book.

Both books were [self-published via Amazon](https://www.joehxblog.com/how-to-self-publish-a-book-on-amazon/). Both could have used a bit of [proofreading](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PJ5GYN8/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). Both had an amateurish feel to their writing style.

Yet both were quite entertaining.
