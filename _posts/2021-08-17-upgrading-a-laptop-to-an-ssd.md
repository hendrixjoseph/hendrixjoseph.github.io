Just a quick video of me replacing the old hard drive in my wife's laptop with a new solid state drive, or SSD:

She'd been complaining about her laptop being slow, and looking at the task manager, it seems that her hard drive was the culprit.

So I upgraded her to a [Samsung 870 QVO SATA III 2.5" SSD 1T](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089C73T72/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20).

I cloned it by connecting it to a USB port with this [USB 3.0 SATA III Hard Drive Adapter Cable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07S9CKV7X/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) and used [Samsung's Data Migration tool](https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/ssd/download/tools/#ge_semi_anchor_stand2). It took an hour and a half to two hours to clone.
