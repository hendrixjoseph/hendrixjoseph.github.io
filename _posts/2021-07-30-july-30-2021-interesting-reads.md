title: Interesting Reads for the Week Ending July 30th
tags: [interesting reads]

Here's what I read that I found interesting over the past week.

## The Rules

Here are the rules for what articles I choose to include in this weekly roundup:

1. It can't be anything I wrote.
2. It has to be something I actually read. Nothing that simply had an interesting headline.
3. I have to have read it since the previous post. It does not have to be something that was written in the past week.
4. It has to be something I read online. In other words, it has to be a webpage with a URL.

## The Reads

This article - [You Can Now Revisit the Most Popular Desktop Publishing App of the '80s in Your Browser](https://gizmodo.com/you-can-now-revisit-the-most-popular-desktop-publishing-1847318273) - reminded me of the desktop publishing software we used on our first computer when I was a kid. It was some sort of Tandy - sold by RadioShack - and it printed on a dot matrix printer. No color.

A few weeks ago I shared a bit about the electric future of Jeep. Well, Chrystler is hinting that electric Jeeps will be able to drive fully underwater. Check out this article [Jeep’s Underwater Electric Wrangler Teaser Isn’t As Unhinged As It May Appear](https://www.carscoops.com/2021/07/jeeps-underwater-electric-wrangler-teaser-isnt-as-unhinged-as-it-may-appear/) and the following video:

[It's About to Get Harder to Buy a Gaming PC](https://gizmodo.com/its-about-to-get-harder-to-buy-a-gaming-pc-1847372953) but not because of chip shortages, but because of legal red tape.

Finally, not quite an article, but the CDC's [COVID Data Tracker](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/) is pretty interesting.
