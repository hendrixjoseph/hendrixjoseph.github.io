title: Interesting Reads for the Week Ending July 23rd
tags: [interesting reads]

Here are the reads I found interesting over the past week.

## The Rules

Here are the rules for what articles I choose to include in this weekly roundup:

1. It can't be anything I wrote.
2. It has to be something I actually read. Nothing that simply had an interesting headline.
3. I have to have read it since the previous post. It does not have to be something that was written in the past week.
4. It has to be something I read online. In other words, it has to be a webpage with a URL.

## The Reads

First off, [The Space Tourism Industry is Stuck in Its Billionaire Phase](https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/17/22573791/space-tourism-industry-bezos-branson-musk-billionaire-phase). If you haven't been paying attention, Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson, both billionaires, recently launched themselves into space*. Queue people complaining that the money could have been spent better. And perhaps they're right - but the benefits (or lack thereof) won't be known for years or even decades.

It makes me wonder if people complained when the [Wright Brothers flew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_brothers#First_powered_flight) or when [Charles Lindberg flew across the Atlantic](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/lindbergh-lands-in-paris). I did see in the [Space Race episode of History 101](https://www.netflix.com/watch/81187208) that people didn't like their tax dollars being spent on the Apollo moon missions.

*Some say not space, but the boundary between space and not-space is not well-defined.

The [California Secretary of State Website Has Income Tax Returns 2016-2020 for Gubernatorial Candidates](https://ballot-access.org/2021/07/19/california-secretary-of-state-website-has-income-tax-returns-2016-2020-for-gubernatorial-candidates/). Like actual, downloadable PDFs of the 1040 forms and schedules that have been submitted to the IRS. If you're a tax nerd and want to see someone else's *real* tax return, check out the [California Secretary of State's Candidate Tax Return Disclosure page](https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/upcoming-elections/2021-ca-gov-recall/candidate-tax-return).

This interests me - [How I changed the law with a GitHub pull request](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/11/how-i-changed-the-law-with-a-github-pull-request/). Honestly, I like the idea of seeing how the law changed over time with a bunch of Git diffs.

Finally, streaming can be free & legal. Check out [Clar Howard's guide on best free streaming services](
