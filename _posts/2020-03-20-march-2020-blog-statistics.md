Coronavirus. COVID-19. Worldwide pandemic. The apocalypse. A lot's happened in the past month, but I've still been able to publish five posts.

Those posts are, of course:

* [Square Closed My Cash App After I Received Over 1,600 Referrals in One Weekend](https://www.joehxblog.com/square-closed-my-cash-app-after-i-received-over-1600-referrals-in-one-weekend/)

## Alexa

Once again my Alexa rank is above one million - except this is the first time the current domain (joehxblog.com) was above million.

* Total Sites Linking In &rarr; 4

My old domain continues to lose "total sites linking in." This month it's at 49 sites, down from 61 in [December 2019](https://www.joehxblog.com/december-2019-blog-statistics/).
