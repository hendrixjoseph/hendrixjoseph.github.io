Another month. Another March. Another book reading list.

I didn't read any books to my son in March. He's in first grade, just turned seven, and is now reading on his own. He's been big on these [Magic Tree House books](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Magic+Tree+House+books&tag=hendrixjoseph-20). He's read somewhere around nine or ten of them.

He still likes being read to. I did read him the first two chapters of Genesis to him - he'd been asking a lot of questions about dinosaurs and Adam and Even. Of course, after reading that he only had more questions.

I did manage to read five different books to my daughter.

I only finished on book for myself.

## Books I Read to My Daughter

* Barbie in the Pink Shoes Ballet Dreams
* I Love My New Toy!
* Rainbow Fish and the Big Blue Whale
* Touch and Feel Farm
* Touch and Feel Pets

## The Book I Read for Me

I read [Project Hail Mary](https://www.amazon.com/Project-Hail-Mary-Andy-Weir-ebook/dp/B08FHBV4ZX/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) by Andy Weir - the same guy who wrote [The Martian](https://www.amazon.com/Martian-Novel-Andy-Weir-ebook/dp/B00EMXBDMA/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) (which I read back in [January 2023](https://www.joehxblog.com/january-2023-book-reading-list/)).

What was different about this reading is that I read it at the same time as my wife. I read it as an ebook on my [Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=kindle&tag=hendrixjoseph-20) whereas she read it as [a hardcover book](https://www.amazon.com/Project-Hail-Mary-Andy-Weir/dp/0593135202/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) from the library. We talked about it some but not much. Her main comment is that it was too science-heavy, but that was something I did enjoy about the book.
