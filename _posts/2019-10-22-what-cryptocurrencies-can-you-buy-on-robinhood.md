Robinhood doesn't have fractional dividends or automatic dividend reinvestments, so I have to figure out what I want to do with those pennies I've been earning as dividends.

I have bought a few other stocks with my dividends, but each time I did have to deposit some additional money.

I am a bit interested in cryptocurrencies - I have an entire [tag](https://www.joehxblog.com/tags/#cryptocurrency) dedicated to them, as well as [a Mix collection](https://mix.com/joehx/cryptocurrency).

And Robinhood sells cryptocurrencies. ~~And unlike stocks, you can buy fractional amounts of crypto (which is good, otherwise few people would be able to buy any Bitcoin).~~

> Update: You've been able to buy fractional shares of stocks on Robinhood for awhile now. Thanks, [Frank Poliat @quickdrawartist](https://twitter.com/quickdrawartist/status/1619808636049694720) for the correction.

Robinhood displays the prices for [several different cryptocurrencies](https://robinhood.com/collections/cryptocurrencies), however, only a subset of these are available for purchase.

Which is a bit frustrating if you want to buy ALL THE THINGS. For diversity's sake, of course.
