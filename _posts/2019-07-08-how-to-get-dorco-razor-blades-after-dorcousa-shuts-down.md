Within the past week, Dorco announced via [email](https://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/c8gpar/fyi_dorco_razors_closeout_sale_theyre_shutting/) that they're shutting down their website, DorcoUSA.com. The good news is that they will continue to sell [Dorco razors via Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/stores/Dorco/page/A608B1E4-4B67-4AA9-A961-9B64093540EE?tag=hendrixjoseph-20).

The email sent out:

> After 7 years of selling you awesome razors at a great price, we will be shutting down DorcoUSA.com.
>
> We will officially be shutting down the site on August 31, 2019, and will be running a closeout sale on DorcoUSA.com until then.
>
> Free shipping will be offered on orders over $25 — stock up on all of your favorites!
> 
> There were many factors that led to this decision, but don’t worry – after August 31st, you’ll still be able to [get Dorco razors online on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/stores/Dorco/page/A608B1E4-4B67-4AA9-A961-9B64093540EE?tag=hendrixjoseph-20)!
>
> Thank you again for being an awesome Dorco customer!"

*RIP DorcoUSA [2011](https://web.archive.org/web/20111103235102/http://www.dorcousa.com/) - 2019*

Oddly enough, I can't find anything about the shutdown on the DorcoUSA website. They do have a [press section](https://web.archive.org/web/20190807153356/https://www.dorcousa.com/press/), but nothing has been published since 2016 ([September 8, 2016](https://web.archive.org/web/20190708174806/https://www.dorcousa.com/dorco-releases-pace-power/), to be exact).

The [UK Dorco site](https://www.razorsbydorco.co.uk/) does mention that "From 1 July 2019, all Dorco products will be available exclusively from www.amazon.co.uk." and does have [a page discussing their move](https://www.razorsbydorco.co.uk/move-to-amazon).

The [Dorco Canada site](https://www.dorcocanada.ca/) looks like a mirror of the US site with no mention of moving to Amazon exclusively.

The free shipping on all orders over $25 is displayed on the top of the website with an asterisk. The "catch" to the free shipping is that it is US only (which makes sense given the site is Dorco**USA**). However, Canada does have free shipping for orders $40 and higher.

The [Canadian Dorco site](https://www.dorcocanada.ca/) mentions the same "Free Shipping When You Spend $25" so Canadian customers will probably be better served buying from that site. 

The discount should be applied automatically; no coupon code needed.

You can currently [buy Dorco blades via Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/stores/Dorco/page/A608B1E4-4B67-4AA9-A961-9B64093540EE?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) and will continue to be able to once DorcoUSA closes. The prices seem to be comparable - as of writing, Amazon only seems to be a few dollars more for the products I was able to find.

I've been using [Pace 3 Disposables](https://www.amazon.com/Dorco-Three-Razor-Shaving-System/dp/B00DH9HK54/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) for several years now. In fact, I bought a rather large amount several years ago during a black Friday sale. I've yet to run out.

I find them comparable to what I used before I bought my Dorcos (the [Gillette Mach 3](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001JQLNH8?tag=hendrixjoseph-20)). The biggest difference is the handle - the Pace 3 has a curvier handle. The blade setup is nearly identical.

There's also the [Dorco Wholesale website](https://web.archive.org/web/20190122181453/https://dorcowholesale.com/) if you want to be a reseller. Note that they currently do not allow reselling on Amazon.

Here are the new links to the various Dorco razor products that I could find:

* [Dorco Pace 3](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O59NRQ6?tag=hendrixjoseph-20)
* [Dorco Pace 4](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008O84ZQA?tag=hendrixjoseph-20)
* [Dorco Pace 6](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MR6WQWA?tag=hendrixjoseph-20)
* [Dorco Pace 6 Plus](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FWPZDWM?tag=hendrixjoseph-20)
* [Dorco Pace 6 Plus Power](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KW0BRVI?tag=hendrixjoseph-20)
* [Dorco Pace 7](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016APMT9I?tag=hendrixjoseph-20)
* [Dorco Shai SoftTouch 6](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FZQ0748?tag=hendrixjoseph-20)

I've also heard that at least some of the [Kroger-branded razors](https://www.kroger.com/pl/all/00?brandName=Kroger&query=razor&searchType=natural) are actually Dorco razors, but I'm unsure if this is true.

Happy shaving!
