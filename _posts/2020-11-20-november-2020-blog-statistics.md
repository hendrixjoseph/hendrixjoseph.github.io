Another month, another dollar. Time for my monthly blog stat report.

Over the past month I only wrote three blog posts:

* [fast.ia ModuleNotFoundError in Google Colab](https://www.joehxblog.com/fast.ia-modulenotfounderror-in-google-colab/)
* [Time as Distance](https://www.joehxblog.com/time-as-distance/)
* [October 2020 Book Reading List](https://www.joehxblog.com/october-2020-book-reading-list/)

## Alexa

My Alexa rank dropped another three-hundred thousand, and is quickly approaching four million:

* Global Rank &rarr; 3,924,894

## Google Analytics

Even though my Alexa rank keeps going up (which is bad) by Google Analytics numbers keep going up. This month, they're all over 2,000:

* Sessions &rarr; 2,340
* Users &rarr; 2,111
* Pageviews &rarr; 2,944

* Clicks &rarr; 1,790
* Search Impressions &rarr; 59,200
* Average position &rarr; 25.6

## AdSense

My AdSense balance is *finally* over $100, which means that I should be getting a direct deposit soon. It hasn't happened yet - I think it can happen at most once a month, and I'm not sure what day of the month it happens. I checked, and I have inputted my bank account and tax info into my AdSense account.

Here are this month's numbers:

* Balance &rarr; $121.48
* Estimated earnings &rarr; $56.21
* Impressions &rarr; 6,950
* Clicks &rarr; 91

It has taken me over four years to get to this point. The first post I made on this iteration of my blog was on [September 2, 2015](https://www.joehxblog.com/java_se7_certificate/). When I looked at my AdSense data, the first date with data was March 30, 2016. The first date with any estimated earnings was June 20, 2016.

In fact, looking at [the commit history for the AdSense code on this blog](https://github.com/hendrixjoseph/hendrixjoseph.github.io/commits/master/_includes/adsense.html), it looks as if I added AdSense on [March 24, 2016](https://github.com/hendrixjoseph/hendrixjoseph.github.io/commit/9270500238725f0bddb8b1abca4d3ec420b070f5).

For fun, I created a little graph showing the growth of my AdSense balance over time:

I last did something like this back in my [July 2018 blog stats post](https://www.joehxblog.com/july-2018-blog-statistics/). This time, however, I saved [the AdSense data](https://github.com/hendrixjoseph/hendrixjoseph.github.io/blob/master/_data/adsense.csv) into a CSV file. Feel free to look at it if you want.

## Moz Stats

Not much has changed with the Moz stats, except that I've lost five linking domains and gone up one point in domain authority:

Moz Domain Authority &rarr; 31
Moz Linking Domains &rarr; 515

## Ratios

* Earnings / 1,000 sessions = $56.21 / 2,340 = $24.02
* Earnings / 1,000 pageviews = $56.21 / 2.944 = $19.09
* Earnings / 1,000 impressions = $56.21 / 6.950 = $8.09
* Earnings / day = $56.21 / 31 = $1.81
* Sessions / day = 2,340 / 31 = 75.5
* Pageviews / day = 2,944 / 31 = 95.0
* Impressions / day = 6,950 / 31 = 224.2
