It's crazy. This iteration of my blog has been going on nearly ten years now (and I've even imported posts from my [old blog](https://www.joehxblog.com/tags/#old-blog), too). I've been doing these blog stat reports regularly every 20th for over seven years.

And the next two months - June and July - will be the first time since I started making these blog stats posts that I won't be able to make them on the twentieth. I'll be out of town. I'll probably just do them the day before I leave.


I published four posts:

* [ChatGPT Spinach, Egg, & Cheddar Fritters](https://www.joehxblog.com/chatgpt-spinach-egg-cheddar-fritters/)
* [Will Pope Leo XIV Vote in US Elections and Pay US Taxes?](https://www.joehxblog.com/will-pope-leo-xiv-vote-in-us-elections-and-pay-us-taxes/)
* [The Ultimate Nature Word Search Book](https://www.joehxblog.com/the-ultimate-nature-word-search-book/)
* [April 2025 Book Reading List](https://www.joehxblog.com/april-2025-book-reading-list/)
