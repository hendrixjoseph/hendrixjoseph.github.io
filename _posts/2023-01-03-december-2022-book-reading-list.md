It's a new month - and a new year! That means, with this post, I've been doing these book reading lists for *five years*.

I read 33 different books to my son - and 12 different books to my daughter.

And I finished two books for myself.

### Books I Read to My Daughter

My daughter recently has become obsessed with the Cat in the Hat. I'm not entirely sure - it just started with her saying it's her favorite book.

We did end up getting her a [Cat in the Hat doll](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D3RDYF3?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) for Christmas - plus the sequel [the Cat in the Hat Comes Back](https://www.amazon.com/Cat-Hat-Comes-Back/dp/0394800028?tag=hendrixjoseph-20).

So here are the 12 books I read to my daughter:

* [Elmo's Christmas Colors](https://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/2462910/77416/2029?u=https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?tn=Elmo's Christmas Colors)
* [Grover's Animal Adventure](https://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/2462910/77416/2029?u=https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?tn=Grover's Animal Adventure)
* [How the Grinch Stole Christmas!](https://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/2462910/77416/2029?u=https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?tn=How the Grinch Stole Christmas)
* [Kindness Grows](https://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/2462910/77416/2029?u=https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?tn=Kindness Grows)

## The Books I Read for Me

As stated earlier, I read two books.

The first book was the parenting book [Raising Your Spirited Child: A Guide for Parents Whose Child Is More Intense, Sensitive, Perceptive, Persistent, and Energetic](https://www.amazon.com/Raising-Your-Spirited-Child-Third-ebook/dp/B00R1R63QK/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). The author uses "spirited" as a more positive adjective than "strong-willed" or "stubborn." And my son is outgoing and energetic - he's extroverted in nature, compared to my introversion. And this exhausts me at time. My daughter is more quiet, like me, but she does have her moments. After all they are four and three.

The other book I read, [The Cuckoo's Egg](https://www.amazon.com/CUCKOOS-EGG-Clifford-Stoll-ebook/dp/B0083DJXCM/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20), is technically a non-fiction book, but I'm considering it fiction in terms of my fiction-then-non-fiction reading habit. It's a narrative, told in the first person (in fact, it's something that happened to the very author who wrote the book, Cliff Stoll) about the one of the first, if not the first, documented case of espionage through networks such as the Internet. I honestly had a hard time putting it down.

2022 - and five years of these posts - is now in the books. Here's to another five!
