Celebrating being debt-free - along with four years of marriage - my wife and took a week-long vacation in Ireland.

Our trip was for the first week of November. And - other than the flight, the car rental, and the first hotel night - nothing was prebooked. Not that I didn't do any preparation. I read a book on Ireland ([Rick Steves’ Ireland](https://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/2462910/77416/2029?u=https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9781612386676)), checked up on any COVID-19 protocols, brushed up on my Irish with Duolingo (dia daoibh!), made sure my [Hotel Tonight](https://www.joehxblog.com/hoteltonight/) app was up-to-date, and that my [Capital One Quicksilver](https://www.joehxblog.com/capital-one-quicksilver/) card - my only card with no foreign transaction fees - had plenty of available credit.

In the week or so since we've been back, I've been retracing our steps across the over 600 miles we drove through Ireland to help us revisit our trip. Below is what I've documented.

## October 30

* Drove from home to Chicago O'Hare Airport:
  * Dropped the kids off at grandma's & grandpa's.

  * Left the car at my wife's cousin's house.
  * Ate tacos for dinner.
  * Took the [CTA Blue Line](https://www.transitchicago.com/blueline/) to Chicago O'Hare Airport.

  * However, my [Quicksilver](https://www.joehxblog.com/capital-one-quicksilver/) worked after this transaction.

* Stayed at the hotel for the night.

## November 1

* Ate breakfast at the hotel. Both my wife and I had our first serving of a "full Irish breakfast" - two sausages, two eggs, two pieces of bacon (which was more like Canadian bacon than American bacon), a hash brown, black and white pudding.

* Picked up the rental car at Sixt at the airport.
  * The car was a little away from the airport, but Sixt did shuttle us to the car park.
