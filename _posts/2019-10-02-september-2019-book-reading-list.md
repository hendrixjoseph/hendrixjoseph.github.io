Some kids are into dinosaurs. Others, trains. Some kids even like trucks. But my son? He likes books.

![Just some of his books.](/images/books/book-shelf-1.jpg)
*Just some of his books.*

He's only eighteen months old - so maybe he's yet to have a dinosaur stage. And he did have a stage a few months ago where he was obsessed with ceiling fans of all things.

But right now, he loves his books. He loves flipping through them. And my wife couldn't be happier for it.

![This isn't even the rest of his books.](/images/books/book-shelf-2.jpg)
*This isn't even the rest of his books.*

I still read books to him, of course. Sometimes I let him turn the pages.

Oh, and he says a few words now: "up," "down," "all done," "clock."

## The Book I Read for Me

I didn't think the book I'm reading right now would take as long as is has - I've been [working on it since July](https://www.joehxblog.com/july-2019-book-reading-list/).

The book is [99 Classic Science-Fiction Short Stories](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RKSDTFP/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). I guess it's been taking so long since there's *99 friggin' stories*.

Oh, well.
