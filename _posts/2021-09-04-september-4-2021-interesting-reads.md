title: Interesting Reads for the Week Ending September 3rd
tags: [interesting reads]
---

A day late - but here, unlike last week. Here's what I read that I found interesting over the past week.

## The Rules

Here are the rules for what articles I choose to include in this weekly roundup:

1. It can't be anything I wrote.
2. It has to be something I actually read. Nothing that simply had an interesting headline.
3. I have to have read it since the previous post. It does not have to be something that was written in the past week.
4. It has to be something I read online. In other words, it has to be a webpage with a URL.

## The Reads

There's nothing wrong with having a script template to say the same thing over and over again. At first, it might feel awkward, but after a while, it will feel natural. This article is great for introverts like me: [The scripts to use when introducing yourself at a networking event, conference, and any other professional meeting](https://www.businessinsider.com/scripts-how-to-introduce-yourself-networking-event-professional-meeting-2021-8).

I actually enjoyed this "bad" comic book movie. [Fan-Hated Marvel Movie Streaming Soon on Amazon Prime](https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/marvel-movie-streaming-soon-amazon-prime-daredevil-ben-affleck/). Spoiler: it's [2003's Dare Devil](https://www.amazon.com/Daredevil-Ben-Affleck/dp/B001GJ1BBQ/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). Also, Netflix has [2011's Green Lantern].

Finally, my son has started asking "why" to everything. He'll ask to go to the park, and then when we're headed to the park, he'll ask why we're headed to the park. Or he'll ask why we're turning left... When I answer it's because that's the way to the grocery store, he'll ask why that's the way to the grocery store, ad infinitum. So that's why I enjoyed this article [Have a Kid Who Constantly Asks 'Why?' Here's Some Genius Mom Advice](https://www.parents.com/news/reddit-mom-gives-genius-advice-dealing-with-kids-who-constantly-as-why/) even though I've already employed some of the ideas.
