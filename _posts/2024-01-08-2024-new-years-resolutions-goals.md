New Year, New Goals.

![Goals 2024](/images/goals-2024.jpg)

Mostly, at least. A lot of the goals my wife and I set for ourselves we roll over from year to year.

This will be the seventh year I've made a post with these goals. Here's the previous six:

* [2023 New Year's Resolutions & Goals](https://www.joehxblog.com/2023-new-years-resolutions-goals/)
* [2022 New Year's Resolutions & Goals](https://www.joehxblog.com/2022-new-years-resolutions-goals/)
* [2021 New Year's Resolutions & Goals](https://www.joehxblog.com/2021-new-years-resolutions-goals/)
* [2020 New Year's Resolutions & Goals](https://www.joehxblog.com/2020-new-years-resolutions-goals/)
* [2019 New Year's Resolutions & Goals](https://www.joehxblog.com/2019-new-years-resolutions-goals/)
* [2018 New Year's Resolutions & Goals](https://www.joehxblog.com/2018-new-years-resolutions-goals/)

Generally, I organize my goals by *abstract, non-SMART goals*. Each abstract goal has a *concrete, SMART,* or at least *semi-SMART* component.

My typical abstract goals are *Improve Our Finances*, *Improve My Health*, *Improve Personally & Professionally*, and *Improve Our Parenting Skills*. You can see them below under the same headers.

For the most part, this post (and all the other goal posts) focus on me; I'm not one to post my children a lot on social media, and I am also respecting my wife's privacy.

## Improve Our Finances

* Max out our Roth IRAs ($7,000 each in 2022)
  * Roughly $583.33 each per month, or $1,166.66 total per month.
* Max out our employer Roth 401(k) accounts ($23,000 each in 2022)
  * I make over six figures, so I set my payroll deductions to 23%.
* Max out my [i401(k) account](https://www.joehxblog.com/i-opened-a-vanguard-individual-401k/) (roughly 20% of any self-employment income)
  * I've still got around $30 to contribute for the 2023 tax year, but I have until tax day to do it.
* $40 per kid per month to their 529 accounts
* Max out the Ohio tax benefit for the kids' 529 accounts ($4,000 per kid)
  * That's roughly $333.33 per kid per month, or $666.66 per month total.

## Improve My Health

* Weigh between just under 200 lbs and 190 lbs
  * I intend to keep an average weekly calorie deficit of 3,500 calories.
  * Workdays, that is, Monday through Friday, I intend to average a 700 calorie deficit
  * Weekends I intend to average at-maintenance (i.e. no deficit and no excess).
  * Once my weight is fluctuating between 190 lbs and 200 lbs, I'll re-evaluate.
* Run a 5k non-stop
* Run a 5k in less than 30 minutes
* Run non-stop for 30 consistently
  * I run every work day during my lunch break. Towards the end of the year last year I was walking five minutes, running thirty, than walking another five, and I was starting to be able to do this regularly. However, I got sick between Thanksgiving and Christmas, plus watched the kids between Christmas and New Years, so I've gotten a little behind.
* Do some sort of at-home strength training (push-ups, crunches, squats, etc) every work day around 2pm.

Last year I had a more measurable strength goal (namely, bench press 50%, 75%, and 100% of my weight). I am able to bench press over 100 lbs (which is about 50% of my weight). I need to rethink if 100%, or 200 lbs, is reasonable.

## Improve Personally & Professionally

* Finish at least one book a month
  * I'm not going to increase this because I don't want to mark a book read just to meet this goal.
* Attend at least one conference or other networking event
* Donate blood as much as possible
  * Last year I donated 5 times.
  * In 2022 I donated 4 times.
  * I just donated on January 4th.
  * That means I've donated 10 times so far.

## Improve Our Parenting Skills

* Read to the kids everyday
* Hike as a family at least twice monthly.
* Volunteer at church at least once.
* Seven or more date nights
* Eat out no more than once a week as a family.
  * We've been eating out less than this recently.
* Maximum of two hours of screen time a day for the kids - and only on weekends.
  * We go a [Nintendo Switch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CHBN8QD9?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) for Christmas - so far the timer on the Parental Controls is working well to encourage my son to stop playing when the time is up.
  * Plus, I always play with him.
* Improve parenting skills by reading a book or taking a parenting class

So there you have it. Is there anything you'd suggest I add? Do you have any goals for this year?
