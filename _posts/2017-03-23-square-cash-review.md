Square Cash is a mobile app that allows you to send money to anyone, instantly. Owned by Square, Inc., it's essentially a competitor to PayPal and Venmo. You may have used a Square terminal at some small businesses.

### Why Square Cash?

My fiancee wanted to send me some money so I could max out my Roth IRA. Initially, I thought to use my PayPal account since it's already setup for me, as I use it for [my eBay business](/six_essential_items_for_reselling_on_ebay_and_amazon/). However, I had heard Square Cash was offering $10 signup and referral bonuses, so I figured the free money was worth it.

### How to use Square Cash

The first time open the app, it will ask you for an email or phone number an thenn it sks you to make a unique "cashtag" that is essentially a username for you to send and receive money.

I actually found Square Cash easier to use than PayPal. The default screen on the app asks you to enter how much money you want to send or receive:

It then asks you who you want to send money to or receive money from. You simply enter their "cashtag" or select someone from your contacts:

*You can also put a note as to what the funds are for, such "for dinner"*

You also link up a debit card that Square Cash will use when you send people money. When you receive money, it just goes into your Square Cash balance. You can link a bank account to deposit your Square Cash balance - there's even an option to automatically deposit any balance into your bank. It takes about one business day, although there's an option to do it instantly, but that costs extra.

### Getting Your Signup Bonus

Unfortunately, you don't automatically get your $10 signup bonus when you install the app. You have to send at least $50 first. Oh, and the only annoying thing I found with Square Cash is that you have to manually type in a referral code in order you get that signup bonus.

*Enter Reward Code on the settings menu. This option disappears once you enter a reward code.*

### Where Can You Get a Reward Code?

Right here! My reward code is [VBWWSRS](http://cash.me/app/VBWWSRS).

The link will take you to another page that links to both the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store, but, as I mentioned earlier, that's not enough to get your bonus. Don't forget to enter it in your settings menu before you send that first $50!
