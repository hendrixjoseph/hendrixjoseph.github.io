What a month it's been in on that statistics side of things for this blog.

First, my Google Analytics have been a bit screwy. Back during the 2016 US election season, Russian trolls were injecting random pro-Trump referral URLs into everyone's Google Analytics accounts, and they seem to be doing it again. Not only is this annoying, but it falsely boosts my numbers. It's an easy fix, though - I just filter out any Google Analytic data that does not come from my URL.

I changed a setting on GitHub Pages - who hosts this blog - to enforce  HTTPS. I then added the HTTPS version of this site to my Google Webmaster account - and it turns out, instead of getting an occasional click here or there, I get several dozen a day. 

Finally, my Alexa rank - which had been hovering around one million - has dropped to somewhere in the 600 thousand numbers and is continuing to drop.

Onto the actual statistics. If you want to view any previous month's statistics, here are the links:
