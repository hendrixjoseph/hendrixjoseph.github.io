It was a rich month in July Google-Adsense wise, but slow in the sense that I didn't write many posts.

In fact, this month I wrote only two posts:

* [2020 Goal Check-In](https://www.joehxblog.com/2020-goal-check-in/)
* [July 2020 Book Reading List](https://www.joehxblog.com/june-2020-book-reading-list/)

One post was my regular "book reading list" posts. The second post I wrote yesterday, breaking my rule of allowing at least one day between posts.

## Alexa

My Alexa rank remains above two million, and is creeping up towards three million:

* Global Rank &rarr; 2,859,618

## Google Analytics

* Sessions &rarr; 1,166
* Users &rarr; 1,060
* Pageviews &rarr; 1,398

341 clicks is *a lot* more clicks than I normally receive; 293 of those clicks were on [4th of July Independence Day Themed Table Topics](https://www.joehxblog.com/4th-of-july-independence-day-themed-table-topics/), which I wrote way back in 2018.

## AdSense

AdSense looked good this month - at least compared to previous months:

* Balance &rarr; $83.00
* Estimated earnings &rarr; $9.37
* Impressions &rarr; 2,074
* Clicks &rarr; 13
