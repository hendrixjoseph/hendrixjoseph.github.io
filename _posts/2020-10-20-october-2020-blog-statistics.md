The twentieth of the month means it's time for my monthly blog stats report. This month it's October - covering the time frame from September 20th - October 19th, 2020.

Over the past month I wrote five blog posts:

* [Jack-o-Lanterns](https://www.joehxblog.com/jack-o-lanterns/)
* [I'm an AbeBooks Affiliate](https://www.joehxblog.com/im-an-abebooks-affiliate/)
* [Where Can You Earn Better Interest Rates Now That Even High-Yield Savings Account Rates are Low?](https://www.joehxblog.com/where-can-you-earn-better-interest-rates-than-savings-account/)
* [September 2020 Book Reading List](https://www.joehxblog.com/september-2020-book-reading-list/)
* [A Not-So-Surprise Hot Air Balloon Ride Belated Birthday Present](https://www.joehxblog.com/a-not-so-surprise-hot-air-balloon-ride-belated-birthday-present/)

## Alexa

My Alexa rank dropped about 200,000, but at almost 4 million, that means it mostly stayed the same:

* Global Rank &rarr; 3,617,637

## Google Analytics

All four of the stats I keep track of are over 1,000 for this month:

* Sessions &rarr; 1,272
* Users &rarr; 1,116
* Pageviews &rarr; 1,692

## Google Search Console

My search console graph has gone a bit crazy this month. The search impressions alone are over 30k - compared to a measly 1,860 last month. Funnily enough, the next highest search impression was [last October](https://www.joehxblog.com/october-2019-blog-statistics/#google-search-console-for-joehxblogcom) at 26,500 impressions.

The page that has taken up nearly half of the impressions is [Unlocking a 2004 Honda Civic Radio and Setting the Clock
](https://www.joehxblog.com/unlocking-a-2004-honda-civic-radio-and-setting-the-clock/) at 14,651 impressions (and a whopping 408 clicks). I guess that makes sense since the time will be changing soon.

* Clicks &rarr; 769
* Search Impressions &rarr; 30,400
* Average position &rarr; 31.4

## AdSense

Less than three bucks to go before I hit the magical $100 and cash out. It's only taken me, what, five years? At 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, that's equivalent to... Not even a penny an hour:

    40 hours * 52 weeks * 5 years = 10,400 hours
    $100 / 10,400 hours ≈ 0.96¢ / hour

* Balance &rarr; $97.41
* Estimated earnings &rarr; $11.28
* Impressions &rarr; 3,077
* Clicks &rarr; 35

## Moz Stats

Not much has changed with the Moz stats, except that I've lost five linking domains:

Moz Domain Authority &rarr; 30
Moz Linking Domains &rarr; 520

## Ratios

* Earnings / 1,000 sessions = $11.28 / 1.272 = $8.87
* Earnings / 1,000 pageviews = $11.28 / 1.692 = $6.67
* Earnings / 1,000 impressions = $11.28 / 3.077 = $3.67
* Earnings / day = $11.28 / 30 = $0.38
* Sessions / day = 1,272 / 30 = 42.4
* Pageviews / day = 1,692 / 30 = 56.4
* Impressions / day = 3,077 / 30 = 102.6
