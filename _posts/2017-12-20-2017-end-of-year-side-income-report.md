Yet another income report. Well, for this blog, it's only the second one - my previous one was [last year's end-of-year income report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2016-end-of-year-side-income-report/). Income reports still seem to be a popular topic in the blogosphere, although most who do income reports do monthly income reports rather than yearly income reports.

### Survey Sites & Rebate Apps

The winner here is clear Amazon Mechanical Turk, but it's only a little over half the $1,227.42 I made last year. That's mostly because I moved my focus more to the print-on-demand sites (details below).

A lot of the surveys from OnGo Surveys / Surveys on the Go I was disqualified from but got a quick 10&cent;. Those dimes quickly added up.

Receipt Hog changed their payout thresholds earlier this year, so I had to cash out at the $20 level under the old system since it gave a better coin-to-cash ratio than any level of the new system. I just recently redeemed 6,500 coins for $40, so together I made $60.

I was surprised I had made anything from Ibotta since I stopped using it a while ago - the twenty or so bucks is just a holdover from 2016 that I cashed out in January.

I don't make as much using eBates as most people, but I think that's either because I won't make a purchase just to get cash back, plus I don't push the referrals much. Here's my [eBates referral link](https://www.joehxblog.com/ebates/).

Square Cash is just referral money, although I'm unsure how much is from my [Square Cash review post](https://www.joehxblog.com/square-cash-review/) and how much is from [/r/churning referral threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/wiki/ccreferrals). Here's my [Square Cash referral link](https://www.joehxblog.com/square-cash/).

site | amount

Amazon Mechanical Turk | $733.19
OnGo Surveys | $77.05
Receipt Hog | $60.00
Ibotta | $20.50
eBates | $33.87
Square Cash | $50.00

### Flipping

Flipping, or arbitrage, is the art of buying something at a low price and then selling later at a higher price. This is essentially how every retailer works. I sell across three platforms, namely Craigslist, Facebook, and eBay. I sell larger items locally, so those go on Craigslist and Facebook. I sold a lot more on Facebook than I did on Craigslist. I also did okay on eBay. Quite a few people sell on Amazon as well, but I haven't gotten into that area.

I actually haven't sold anything in the last couple months. I've increased my focus on print-on-demand sites, which doesn't require an inventory. Plus I've been focusing on decluttering.

You can check out what I'm currently selling on eBay here &rarr; [https://www.ebay.com/sch/yknowitsjoe/m.html](https://www.ebay.com/sch/yknowitsjoe/m.html&mkcid=1&mkrid=711-53200-19255-0&siteid=0&campid=5337996799&customid=&toolid=10001&mkevt=1). As you can see, there's not a lot right now, maybe about ten items.

### Credit Card Rewards

I'm quite surprised how much I made on the two Chase cards considering I received the bonuses for them last year, I've had no referrals,  and won't spend money just to get points. Here are my [Chase Freedom referral link](https://www.joehxblog.com/chase-freedom/) and my [Chase Freedom Unlimited referral link](https://www.joehxblog.com/chase-freedom-unlimited/) if you're interested - both are a $150 bonus after $500 spend. Be sure to read the fine print and details for each.

I got the [Quicksilver](https://www.joehxblog.com/capital-one-quicksilver/) for my honeymoon trip to Iceland since there are no foreign transaction fees. I believe the bonus was $150, and Capital One provides no referral bonuses.

There are no referrals for the US Bank card, either.

Card | Amount
--- | ---
Chase Freedom Unlimited | $577.05
Chase Freedom | $661.26
Capital One Quicksilver | $353.55
US Bank Cash+ | $197.93

### Bank Accounts

Only three of these are checking account bonuses - US Bank, Quorum, and Santander. I've since closed the US Bank and Santander accounts, but I've kept the Quorum open since they provided me free checks. I might close it once all the checks are gone - which, at the rate I write checks, might be never.

WPCU (Wright-Patt Credit Union) is a popular local credit union. In addition to some dividends they pay out, they provide a savings account that has 3% interest on the first $500.

Finally, Ally is a high-interest savings account that I keep most of my emergency fund in. They started the year at 1.00% interest, and after raising the rate a couple times, are finishing the year at 1.25%. Considering most banks do somewhere around 0.01% interest, it's a no-brainer. Check out my post on [living off the interest](https://www.joehxblog.com/living-off-the-interest/) if you want to see what a drastic difference that is.

bank | type | amount
--- | --- | ---
US Bank | checking account | $200.06
Quorum | checking account | $305.36
Santander | checking account | $450.00
WPCU | checking & savings account | $199.14
Ally | savings account | $112.24

### Print-On-Demand Sites

These are mostly t-shirt designs. I never expected [my Amazon t-shirts](https://www.joehxblog.com/t-shirts/) to sell so well. I more expected something like my [TeeSpring](https://www.joehxblog.com/my-first-teespring-designs/) or [Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com/people/joehx) sales.

I'm not complaining, though.

site | amount
--- | ---
Merch by Amazon | $996.15
TeeSpring | $17.48 + $18.00 = $35.48
Redbubble | $2.72

### Blogging

Here's where I really scraped by - with this blog and my [dog-oriented blog](https://www.puppy-snuggles.com/). Neither site was designed to make a ton of money. They're both intended to improve my web design and writing skills.

That said, I did make a small amount from Amazon Affiliates. $1.28 of that was carry over from last year. There's an additional $9.50 that I won't be paid until next year.

Google AdSense has a minimum payment threshold of $100 so I have a long way to go before I get paid. I did better than I did last year, though - my balance at the end of 2016 was only a paltry $1.27.

Amazon Affiliates | $34.12
Google Adsense | $11.22
