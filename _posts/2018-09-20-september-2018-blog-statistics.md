It's been a steady month in terms of stats for this blog. While there hasn't been much in the terms of improvement stats-wise, they have remained consistently good.

There was a small spike in pageviews on August 21st due to my article [Will Making Twice-Monthly Half Mortgage Payments Save Money?](/will-making-twice-monthly-half-mortgage-payments-save-money/) being featured on the Noteworthy section of the [Rockstar Finance](https://rockstarfinance.com/) email.

There's also a new set of statistics this month - stats from Google Search Console.

## Google Search Console

New for this month is Google Search Console statistics. I'd previously submitted the non-HTTPS (i.e. HTTP) to Google Webmasters / Search Console a long time ago, but only recently submitted the HTTPS version - sometime on or around August 7th. Apparently, that's why my stats for Google Search Console had looked so *bad*.  I'm sure Google had already indexed my pages and was putting them on search results, I just had no idea.

* Clicks &rarr; 612
* Search Impressions &rarr; 26,700
* Average position &rarr; 19.2
