2024 is over and, with this post, wraps up *seven years* of these book reading lists.

I read sixteen different books to my son and twenty-one different books to my daughter.

Compared to November, where I didn't finish any books, I finished three books in December.

## The Books I Read for Me

I finally finished [Python in a Nutshell](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Nutshell-Desktop-Quick-Reference/dp/1098113551/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) by Alex Martelli, Anna Martelli Ravenscroft, and Steve Holden. If you want to read it, too, keep in mind it's not really intended to be read cover-to-cover, but more as a reference book.

I then went on to read the final Foundation book [Foundation and Earth](https://www.amazon.com/Foundation-Earth-Isaac-Asimov/dp/0553587579/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). There's plenty more Isaac Asimov books to read, even in the same "universe" as the Foundation series, but for the next few fiction books I read, I'm going to try someone else.

Finally, I also read [Food Rules: An Eater's Manual](https://www.amazon.com/Food-Rules-Eaters-Michael-Pollan/dp/014311638X/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) by Michael Pollan. This was a quick read - I read it in a single sitting. There was nothing ground-breaking about this book - it just provides a number of rules of thumb" or quick guidelines to help people eat more healthily.
