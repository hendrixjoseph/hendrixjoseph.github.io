Slows days here in the blogosphere, but I keep on trucking.

I was only able to publish three posts this month:

* [My Experience at an Investment Basics Seminar](https://www.joehxblog.com/my-experience-at-an-investment-basics-seminar/)
* [January 2020 Book Reading List](https://www.joehxblog.com/january-2020-book-reading-list/)
* [2020 New Year's Resolutions & Goals](https://www.joehxblog.com/2020-new-years-resolutions-goals/)

## Alexa

My Alexa ranking keeps getting worse. [Two months ago](https://www.joehxblog.com/december-2019-blog-statistics/) it was at 241,132. [Last month](https://www.joehxblog.com/january-2020-blog-statistics/) it was at 312,868. This month... well, look below.

* Global Rank &rarr; 516,963
* Rank in the United States &rarr; ??
* Total Sites Linking In &rarr; 4

I'm assuming it's because I haven't been able to post as much. This month and last month I only made three posts. That last time I made three posts in a month was in [May of 2018](https://www.joehxblog.com/may-2018-blog-statistics/).

But I also have heard rumors that Google made some changes halfway through January, so that could be it too.

Also, the old free "Rank in the United States" has disappeared for [my site](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/joehxblog.com), although it's still present for sites such as [Google](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/google.com) and [Amazon](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/amazon.com).

My old domain continues to lose "total sites linking in." This month it's at 54 sites, down from 57 last month and 61 the month before.

## Google Analytics

Just like my Alexa rank keeps getting worse, so do my Google Analytics stats:

* Sessions &rarr; 787
* Users &rarr; 702
* Pageviews &rarr; 1,018

## Google Search Console

And my Google Search Console stats are going down, too:

* Clicks &rarr; 217
* Search Impressions &rarr; 2,750
* Average position &rarr; 55.7

## AdSense

Oddly enough, despite all my other already mentioned stats going down, my AdSense stats are looking pretty good:

* Balance &rarr; $64.13
* Estimated earnings &rarr; $3.51
* Impressions &rarr; 1,580
* Clicks &rarr; 16

## Mox Domain Authority

I've decided to start including another measure- [Domain Authority](https://moz.com/learn/seo/domain-authority) as measured by Moz.com.

Domain Authority can range from 1 through 100. The higher the number, the better.

Moz says that they use a "machine learning model" to determine Domain Authority. If their method is like anything Google users for their PageRank algorithm, then Domain Authority of one domain is simply a function of the Domain Authorities of domains that link to that one domain.

I did backtrack and add previous Domain Authority numbers to [my spreadsheet](https://github.com/hendrixjoseph/hendrixjoseph.github.io/blob/master/_data/blog-stats.csv). Those numbers are, including this month's numbers:

February 2020 &rarr; 31
January 2020 &rarr; 30
December 2019 &rarr; 30
November 2019 &rarr; 31
October 2019 &rarr; 32
September 2019 &rarr; 26
August 2019 &rarr; 22

## Ratios

* Earnings / 1,000 sessions = $3.51 / 0.787 = $4.46
* Earnings / 1,000 pageviews = $3.51 / 1.018 = $3.45
* Earnings / 1,000 impressions = $3.51 / 1.580 = $2.22
* Earnings / day = $3.51 / 31 = $0.11
* Sessions / day = 787 / 31 = 25.4
* Pageviews / day = 1,018 / 31 = 32.8
* Impressions / day = 1,580 / 31 = 51.0
