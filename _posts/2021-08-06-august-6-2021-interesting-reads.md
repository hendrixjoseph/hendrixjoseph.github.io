Here's what I read that I found interesting over the past week.

## The Rules

Here are the rules for what articles I choose to include in this weekly roundup:

1. It can't be anything I wrote.
2. It has to be something I actually read. Nothing that simply had an interesting headline.
3. I have to have read it since the previous post. It does not have to be something that was written in the past week.
4. It has to be something I read online. In other words, it has to be a webpage with a URL.

## The Reads

Somewhat ironic... [Wall of ice collapses at Titanic Museum in Tennessee](https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/iceberg-wall-collapse-titanic-museum-tennessee-hurts-79246224).

Somewhat frustrating... [Paramount+ Drops Star Trek Content After Luring Star Trek Fans There To Watch it](https://www.giantfreakinrobot.com/?p=265227). Bit of clickbait title - only some movies were dropped. Although I thought it was odd since I was under the impression that the movies and the series were all under one roof now.

Best [GitHub Availability Report](https://github.blog/2021-08-04-github-availability-report-july-2021/). Here's a summary:

> In July, we experienced no incidents resulting in service downtime to our core services.

What I found most interesting about this article - [The IRS has seized $1.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency this fiscal year](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/04/irs-has-seized-1point2-billion-worth-of-cryptocurrency-this-year-.html) - is the first bullet point:

> The U.S. government regularly holds auctions for its stockpile of bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin and other cryptocurrencies it seizes and then holds in crypto wallets.

For instance, check out [this action for 150.22567153 litecoin and 0.00022893 bitcoin cash](https://gsaauctions.gov/gsaauctions/aucdsclnk?sl=4TQSCI21402001).

Lastly, check out this display from the opening ceremony at the Tokyo Olympics with 1,800 lighted drones:
