Ok, ok, so most "low content" print-on-demand books are notebooks that are 90% blank, and puzzle books aren't quite that blank.

But I did it. I published a puzzle book on Amazon. A *Sudoku* Puzzle book.

Not sure how search-engine-friendly the title is. Or even if the description is any good.

But I named the book [100 Sudoku Puzzles: 25 Easy · 25 Medium · 25 Hard · 25 Very Hard with Solutions Included](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1707062951?tag=hendrixjoseph-20).

[Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) is more a pattern game than a numbers game. You take nine different characters (which, just happen to be the digits one through nine) and make sure you can fill a 9x9 grid without repeating them in a row, column, diagonal, or one of the 3x3 sub-blocks:

## Making the Sudoku Book

I only needed two pieces of software to make the book.

For the contents of the Sudoku book, I used [Microsoft Word](https://products.office.com/en-us/word-c). I used more aspects of Word than I've ever used before - from formating (such as section breaks) and even some VBA scripts to help apply the same format to all the books. A whoever decided to make the "print-to-PDF" option is a pure genius since KDP prefers PDF.

For the cover of the Sudoku book,, I used [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). Inkscape allows you to save as PDF - which wasn't in the most intuitive spot, but it worked once I found it.

## Some Takeaways from Making the Sudoku Book

I have the darnedest time spelling *Sudoku* right. I get the consonants right, but I keep typing all U's or all O's. *Suduku*, *sodoko*, heck, sometimes even *sodoku*.

Also, since this is the third book I've published on Amazon's platform (the other two are just ebooks), I made an [Amazon author page](https://www.amazon.com/author/joehx?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). Amazon let me hood up the RSS feeds for my blogs (just this one and my [dog blog](https://www.puppy-snuggles.com/)), which will (hopefully!) get me some valid backlinks on Amazon.

I did buy an "author copy" to check the formatting. And when I [shared my Sudoku book on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/JoeHxBlog/posts/2523968357681207), someone bought it! (Thanks mom!)
