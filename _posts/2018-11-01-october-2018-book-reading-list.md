October was a pretty busy month for me. [We bought a van]({{ site.url }}/we-bought-a-van/). I've been hard at work on [remodeling the master bathroom]({{ site.url }}/master-bath-remodel-demolition/). And, of course, I've been busy helping my wife [take care of our seven-month-year-old son]({{ site.url }}/a-mostly-financial-pregnancy-timeline-and-the-first-four-months-of-life-my-experience-as-a-new-dad/).

I still made sure I had time to read, though.

## Books I Read for Me

I was only able to read one book in the entire month of October:

[![Star Trek: The Eugenics Wars: The Rise and Fall of Khan Noonien Singh: Volume 1](/images/books/star-trek-the-eugenics-war.jpg)*Star Trek: The Eugenics Wars: The Rise and Fall of Khan Noonien Singh: Volume 1*](https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9780743406420/30193774623)

In fact, I started the book at the end of September and didn't finish it until the last day of October - I finished reading it while waiting for trick-or-treaters to show up at my front door (sadly, no one came to my door for candy).

Now I need to figure out what I want to read in November.

## Books I Read to My Son

It's hard to believe the little guy is already over seven months old. I know it's cliche, but it's amazing how quickly he grows and changes. There is so much change even week to week. One week he'll stay at the same place we set him down, the next he'll scoot to where he wants to go.

Of course, I continue to read to him. Here are the books I read to him in October:

* [Dear Zoo: A Lift-the-Flap Book](https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9781416947370/22895150425)
* [Dog Wants to Play](https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9780670016334/22915683944)
* [If I Could Keep You Little](https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9781934082928/22765913444)
* [I Love My Puppy](https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9780545835947/22451989377)
* [My First Superman Book: Touch and Feel](https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9781935703006/30219713170)
* [Daddy Hugs by Karen Katz](https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9780689877711/22718106864)
* [Simon Says... Roar Like a Lion!](https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9781780656045/30135176868)
* [Polar Bear, Polar Bear, What Do You Hear?](https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9780805053883/30130515213)
* [Fisher-Price: Peekaboo, Baby! Faces & Feelings](https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9780007285747/30182001218)

If you've kept up with my book reading posts, you'll notice that I read some of the same books to him. I often read the same book to him multiple times, so just because there are only nine books listed above, doesn't mean I only read to him nine times.

Onto November!
