Chugging along, month after month, reading book after book.

## Books I Read to My Children

### Books I Read to My Son

[Last month](https://www.joehxblog.com/august-2020-book-reading-list/) I read a whopping thirty different books to my son.

This month I only managed to read twenty-six. Maybe I read less because September is one day shorter than August. Or maybe it's because my son has become obsessed with a certain book - meaning he wants to read and reread that particular book.

Before I mention which book he's become obsessed with, let me list the books I read to him in September:

### Books I Read to My Daughter

Last month I read fourteen books to my daughter - this month I read sixteen. So, that's an improvement. She's too young to become obsessed with an individual book, so it's easier to read different books to her.

Here are the books I read to her:

* [B is for Bedtime!](https://affiliates.abebooks.com/c/2462910/77416/2029?u=https://www.abebooks.com/products/isbn/9780399558122)

## The Book I Read for Me

This month I read [*Effective Java 3rd Edition* by Joshua Bloch](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0134685997/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). And despite the author stating that this "book is not intended to be read from
cover to cover" - I read it cover to cover.

The book I'm currently reading... Well, you'll have to find out next month what it is. I'll give you three hints:

* It's fiction.
* It's from a favorite author I read during my childhood.
* I'm reading it via free [Prime Reading](https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/fd/prime-pr?tag=hendrixjoseph-20).

If you have Amazon Prime, you have Prime Reading. If you don't have Amazon Prime, well, let me copy-and-paste the following from my [January 2019 Book Reading List](https://www.joehxblog.com/january-2019-book-reading-list/):

> If you don't have Amazon Prime, you can [try Amazon Prime with a 30-Day free trial](https://www.amazon.com/tryprimefree?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). There's also [Prime Discounted Monthly Offering](https://www.amazon.com/l/16256994011?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) if you qualify, as well as a [
Prime Student 6-month Trial](https://www.amazon.com/gp/student/signup/info/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) if you have a .edu email address.

Until next month.
