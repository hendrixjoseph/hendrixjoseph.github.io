February is over. So what did I read last month?

I read only two different books to my son and six different books to my daughter.

I finished two books for myself.

## The Book I Read for Me

I broke my fiction-then-non-fiction-then-back-to-fiction approach to reading last month - mainly because I had a book on hold via the Libby app that I am currently reading at the same time as my wide.

I broke the rule and read two non-fiction books back-to-back: [Infectious Generosity: The Ultimate Idea Worth Spreading](https://www.amazon.com/Infectious-Generosity-Ultimate-Worth-Spreading/dp/059372755X/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) and [Metabolical: The Lure and the Lies of Processed Food, Nutrition, and Modern Medicine](https://www.amazon.com/Metabolical-Processed-Nutrition-Modern-Medicine/dp/0063027712/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20).
