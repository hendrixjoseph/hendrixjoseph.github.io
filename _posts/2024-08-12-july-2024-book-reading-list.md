Over a week into August and I'm just not putting out my monthly book reading list.

Our kids' summer program ended on August 2nd, and school doesn't start until August 14th, so for the week of August 5th through August 9th we had *fun week*. Which is the name my six-year-old son named the week between that my wife and I do a "staycation" and do fun things with our kids, such as [COSI](https://cosi.org/) and [Kings Island](https://www.visitkingsisland.com/).

But July 2024 is over and I need to make the book reading list.

I almost made it to the end of July without reading my son a single book - but I did make sure to read at least one book to him before the month was over.

And I read 15 books to my daughter.

### Books I Read to My Son

The sole book I read to my son was [Goodnight Moon](https://www.amazon.com/Goodnight-Moon-Margaret-Wise-Brown/dp/0060775858/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20).

That said, I have also been reading him a chapter book. Last night we finished chapter four!

## The Books I Read for Me

I read more of Isaac Asimov's Foundation series. This time the book was simply titled [Foundation](https://www.amazon.com/Foundation-Isaac-Asimov/dp/0553293354/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20). It's book 3 according to Libby, but book 1 according to Amazon. I believe that has to do with publication order versus in-universe chronological order.

I also read through [Marcus Aurelius' Meditations](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=meditations+marcus+aurelius&i=digital-text). Honestly, I didn't get much out of it. Perhaps it requires greater study than simply reading through it.
