It's the end of an era. After 8 years of doing monthly book reading lists, this will be my last.

My kids are getting more and more literate - meaning they can read on there own. My son *loves* to read. My daughter, who just turned 6, can read, and will hopefully pick up the joy of reading on her own soon.

Both still love to be read to - and, each December, my wife and I wrap 50 different "Christmas books" for them to unwrap - one book each per day on the days leading up to Christmas. Which means December is a month of more reading to my kids.

I read seven to my daughter:

* A Special Place for Santa
* Elmore the Christmas Moose
* If You Take a Mouse to the Movies
* The Berenstain Bears Meet Santa Bear
* The Great Santa Stakeout
* The Grumpy Reindeer
* What Santa Can't Do

And the 12 books to my son:

* A Christmas Too Big
* A Special Place for Santa
* Elmore the Christmas Moose
* If You Take a Mouse to the Movies
* The Berenstain Bears Meet Santa Bear
* The Great Santa Stakeout
* The Grumpy Reindeer
* The Lost Gift
* The Slider Who Saved Christmas
* This is the Stable
* What Santa Can't Do
* Yes, Virginia, There is a Santa Claus

Now, I am not done reading myself. Indeed, in December, I finished two books: [The Third Rule of Time Travel](https://www.amazon.com/Third-Rule-Time-Travel-ebook/dp/B0D8HW9B94/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) by Philip Fracassi and [The Anxious Generation](https://www.amazon.com/Anxious-Generation-Rewiring-Childhood-Epidemic-ebook/dp/B0C9F37G28/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) by Jonathan Haidt.

*The Third Rule of Time Travel* uses a form of time travel more akin to *The Butterfly Effect* - where one travels only within one's own consciousness - although, in the case of *The Third Rule of Time Travel*, you can only observe.

*The Anxious Generation* is about how screen time is causing anxiety in today's youth. Or really in everyone. But it also touches how lack of real-world interactions is also causing anxiety.

While this may be my last monthly book reading list, it won't be the last time I write about what I read. Going forward, I plan on giving a quick blurb on whatever book I just finished, as I finished it. It won't be a review - I don't like giving star-ratings or saying it's 10 out of ten or what have you - just my thoughts on the book itself. Hopefully having just read the book will leave it fresh in my mind for when I write.
