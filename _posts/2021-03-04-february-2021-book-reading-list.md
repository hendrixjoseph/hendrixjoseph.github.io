## Books I Read to My Children

### Books I Read to My Son

I read 31 books to my son last month. The main reason it's less this month than last month it many of these books I read to him *multiple* times.

## The Books I Read for Me

For February I actually finished two books.

The first book was book 4 in the [the Cluster Series](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07G2235FK/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20): *Thousandstar*.

The other book - which, to be fair, was fairly short - was [*The Law* by Frédéric Bastiat](https://store.fee.org/collections/best-sellers/products/the-law).
