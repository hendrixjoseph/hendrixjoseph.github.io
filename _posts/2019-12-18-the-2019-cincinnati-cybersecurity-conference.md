Next year I want to start going to more conferences. Specifically, conferences in my industry. I'm a software engineer, so that means IT conferences.

The thing is I don't want to wait. I don't like New Year's Resolutions not because I don't like to make goals, but rather I want to make goals on an ongoing basis.

So when I began searching for potential conferences to go to, I didn't just look for conferences next year - I looked for conferences that might be held during the remaining bit of this year as well.

And, well, I found one. A free one (for "IT professionals") and somewhat local - only an hour away in Cincinnati.

The conference? The [2019 Cincinnati Cybersecurity Conference](https://www.dataconnectors.com/events/cincinnati2019/) by [Data Connectors](https://www.dataconnectors.com/).

Now, it's a free event - or, free to me - meaning that I am the product. There were vendors at this conference - cybersecurity vendors, sure, but vendors nevertheless.

Meaning they want to sell their products and services. Thankfully, I am not in a position whatsoever to buy their products and services.

## My Thoughts on the 2019 Cincinnati Cybersecurity Conference

The hour-long drive down to Cincinnati gave me time to catch up on some of [the Podcasts I've been listening to](https://www.joehxblog.com/the-top-seven-podcasts-to-start-listening-to/).

There were eight different sessions (more like presentations) at the conference. Although they were all done by vendors, none of them felt as if I were being sold anything. That's not to say the presenters never mentioned their products; it's just those products were presented neutrally.

After the eight sessions, there was a <abbr title="chief information security officer">CISO</abbr> panel. Five C-Level executives (they weren't all CISOs or CIOs, but close enough) answered questions from the audience; most of the questions were fielded beforehand, however. The CISO panel was led by John Pisano of Booz Allen Hamilton.

Data Connectors tweeted some pictures from the event - you can see my blue shirt and bald head in at least one of the images:

## Lunch

Lunch was free. And it was also the only picture I took.

## Swag, or See-What-Ah-Got

A conference isn't a conference without some [swag](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/what-does-swag-mean).

My wife likes canvas totes, so I made sure to get a bunch of those. I also picked up a couple of sunglasses for her.

There were plenty of pens, a few [laptop webcam covers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RV6ZQL4/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20), and of course promotional pamphlets.

I got a few cool things, too:

* A [a USB Data Blocker aka "USB Condom"](https://www.amazon.com/stores/node/7645179011/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20):

## Continuing Education Units

CompTIA allows <abbr title="continuing education unit">CEU</abbr>s to be earned by [attending conferences](https://www.comptia.org/continuing-education/choose/renewing-with-multiple-activities/training-and-higher-education#conference) - provided, of course, that the conference is relevant ("At least 50 percent of the conference session content must relate to one or more of the exam objectives for the certification youâ€™re renewing").

I've gotten my <abbr title="CompTIA Advanced Security Professional">CASP</abbr>, so this conference provided me with 9 hours worth of CEUs.

Plus I got this fancy certificate (completely digital, unless I print it out):

## Networking

The vendors were more than happy to talk to me, even when they could tell I wasn't in a position to buy their services.

I didn't talk much with anyone else. I did end up connecting with two people via LinkedIn.

Maybe I will do better next time?
