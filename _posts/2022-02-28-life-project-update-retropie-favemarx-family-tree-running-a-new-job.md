I haven't been able to post much lately, so I'll quickly layout what projects I've been up to these past couple of months.

## RetroPie

I bought a [CanaKit Raspberry Pi 4 Extreme Kit - 128GB Edition](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08B6G2RFG/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20) from Amazon and installed [RetroPie](https://retropie.org.uk/) on it.

The idea being that I could play games I never had a change to, as well as play games with my children.

## Favemarx

Late last year Google decided to discontinue the [Google Bookmarks](https://www.google.com/bookmarks/) product with the following message:

> After September 30th 2021, Google Bookmarks will no longer be supported. To save your bookmarks, click on "Export bookmarks".

So I decided to make my own product [Favemarx](https://github.com/hendrixjoseph/favemarx). It's still a work in progress - even though my goal was to launch it in October 2021. Here's what the front page tentatively will look like:

Oddly, Google Bookmarks still exists, and now have the following message on top:

> Google Bookmarks is no longer a supported product. To save your bookmarks, click on "Export bookmarks".

## Ancestry.com & AncestryLibrary.com

I discovered that my local library has access to [AncestryLibrary.com](https://www.ancestrylibrary.com/) - and that the URL structures are almost identical between the two domains - save for the domains themselves.

To easily switch between the two sites, I created a little Tampermonkey script I call the [Ancestry.com/AncestryLibrary.com Switcheroo](https://gist.github.com/hendrixjoseph/c56645c48c2cacc9fd9866fe91c82abd). Ctrl-LeftShift switches the current page between the two domains. Ctrl-RightShift switches all links on the page from one domain to the other. And Ctrl-Click opens a link in the other domain.

## Running

I can now run a half-hour without stopping. Honestly, at this point I think my limit is more mental than physical.

Also, I ran a [five-mile race](https://orrrc.org/?p=2543) earlier this month and finished in under an hour:

## New Job

After 8 years at Northrop Grumman, I've decided it was time to advance my career and move on to another company. I now work at Optum,
