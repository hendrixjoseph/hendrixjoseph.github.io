It's the 20th of the final month of 2020. Time for another edition of my monthly blog stats report - and with this edition, I will have two year's worth of these posts.

Since today's Sunday and it's almost Christmas, I'm fairly busy, so I'll just give the numbers with no context.

Over the past month I wrote six blog posts:

* [Moving My Stocks From Bumped to Robinhood in Five Days (Manually)](https://www.joehxblog.com/moving-my-stocks-from-bumped-to-robinhood-in-five-days/)
* [2020 End of Year Side Income Report](https://www.joehxblog.com/2020-end-of-year-side-income-report/)
* [There are No Neutral Laws](https://www.joehxblog.com/there-are-no-neutral-laws/)
* [My Attempt at a Muppet Classifier Using fast.ai](https://www.joehxblog.com/my-attempt-at-a-muppet-classifier-using-fast.ai/)
