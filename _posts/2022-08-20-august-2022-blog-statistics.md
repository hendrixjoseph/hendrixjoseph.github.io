20\. 20th. Twenty. Twentieth. It's the twentieth, which means it's time to report my blog statistics.

I made three posts in the past month:

* [The Tale of my Wife's Laptop Battery](https://www.joehxblog.com/the-tale-of-my-wifes-laptop-battery/)
* [Introducing JoeHx Tees](https://www.joehxblog.com/introducing-joehx-tees/)
* [July 2022 Book Reading List](https://www.joehxblog.com/july-2022-book-reading-list/)

## Alexa

As I've been saying on my past reports, Alexa is no more. Just try to go to [my Alexa site info page](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/joehxblog.com).

But the Alexa browser extension on Firefox continues to give Alexa rankings... For now.
