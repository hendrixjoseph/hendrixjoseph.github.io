Last month in May I read 29 books to my son and 22 books to my daughter while managing to finish two books for myself.

## The Books I Read for Me

I read one fiction book ([Jurassic Park](https://www.amazon.com/Jurassic-Park-Novel-Michael-Crichton-ebook/dp/B007UH4D3G/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20)) and one non-fiction book ([Tribe of Hackers](https://www.amazon.com/Tribe-Hackers-Cybersecurity-Advice-World/dp/1119643376/?tag=hendrixjoseph-20)).

*Tribe of Hackers* gave me a good list of other, mostly non-fiction books to read.

Now I'm reading another fiction book. Based on May's reading, do you have any guess what I'm reading now?
